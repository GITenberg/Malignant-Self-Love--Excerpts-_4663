*******This file should be named malsl10.txt or malsl10.zip******

Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net/pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">A Primer on Narcissism</span></h1>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Narcissism (n. sing.)</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A pattern of traits and behaviours which
signify infatuation and obsession with one's self to the
exclusion of all others and the egotistic and ruthless pursuit of
one's gratification, dominance and ambition.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Narcissism is named after the ancient Greek
myth of Narcissus who was a handsome Greek youth who rejected the
desperate advances of the nymph Echo. In punishment of his
cruelty, he was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection in
a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, he pined away and
changed into the flower that bears his name to this very
day.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">What is NPD (Narcissistic Personality
Disorder)?</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)
has been recognised as a separate mental health disorder in the
third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM) in
1980. Its diagnostic criteria and their interpretation have
undergone a major revision in the DSM-III-R [1987] and were
substantially revamped in the DSM-IV in 1994. The European ICD-10
basically contains identical language.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">An all-pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in
fantasy or behaviour), need for admiration or adulation and lack
of empathy, usually beginning by early adulthood and present in
various contexts. Five (or more) of the following criteria must
be met:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Feels grandiose and self-importance (e.g., exaggerates
achievements and talents to the point of lying, demands to be
recognised as superior without commensurate achievements);</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Is obsessed with fantasies of unlimited success, fame, fearsome
power or omnipotence, unequalled brilliance (the cerebral
narcissist), bodily beauty or sexual performance (the somatic
narcissist), or ideal, everlasting, all-conquering love or
passion;</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Firmly convinced that he or she is unique and, being special, can
only be understood by, should only be treated by, or associate
with, other special or unique, or high-status people (or
institutions);</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Requires excessive admiration, adulation, attention and
affirmation &ndash; or, failing that, wishes to be feared and to
be notorious (Narcissistic Supply);</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Feels entitled. Expects unreasonable or special and favourable
priority treatment. Demands automatic and full compliance with
his or her expectations;</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Is "interpersonally exploitative", i.e., uses others to achieve
his or her own ends;</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Devoid of empathy. Is unable or unwilling to identify with or
acknowledge the feelings and needs of others;</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Constantly envious of others or believes that they feel the same
about him or her;</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&bull;</span>
Arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes coupled with rage when
frustrated, contradicted, or confronted.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The language in the criteria above is based
on or summarised from:</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">More Data About Pathological
Narcissists</span></h3>

<p>&bull; Most narcissists (75%) are men.</p>

<p>&bull; NPD (=the Narcissistic Personality Disorder) is one of
a "family" of personality disorders (formerly known as "Cluster
B"). Other members: Borderline PD, Antisocial PD and Histrionic
PD.</p>

<p>&bull; NPD is often diagnosed with other mental health
disorders ("co-morbidity") &ndash; or with substance abuse, or
impulsive and reckless behaviours ("dual diagnosis").</p>

<p>&bull; NPD is new [1980] mental health category in the
Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM).</p>

<p>&bull; There is only scant research regarding narcissism. But
what there is has not demonstrated any ethnic, social, cultural,
economic, genetic, or professional predilection to NPD.</p>

<p>&bull; It is estimated that 0.7-1% of the general population
suffer from NPD.</p>

<p>&bull; Pathological narcissism was first described in detail
by Freud. Other major contributors are: Klein, Horney, Kohut,
Kernberg, Millon, Roningstam, Gunderson, Hare.</p>

<p>&bull; The onset of narcissism is in infancy, childhood and
early adolescence. It is commonly attributed to childhood abuse
and trauma inflicted by parents, authority figures, or even
peers.</p>

<p>&bull; There is a whole range of narcissistic reactions
&ndash; from the mild, reactive and transient to the permanent
personality disorder.</p>

<p>&bull; Narcissists are either "cerebral" (derive their
Narcissistic Supply from their intelligence or academic
achievements) &ndash; or "somatic" (derive their Narcissistic
Supply from their physique, exercise, physical or sexual prowess
and "conquests").</p>

<p>&bull; Narcissists are either "classic" &ndash; see definition
below &ndash; or they are "compensatory", or "inverted" &ndash;
see definitions in FAQ 37: The Inverted Narcissist.</p>

<p>&bull; NPD is treated in talk therapy (psychodynamic or
cognitive-behavioural). The prognosis for an adult narcissist is
poor, though his adaptation to life and to others can improve
with treatment. Medication is applied to side effects and
behaviours (such as mood or affect disorders and
obsession-compulsion) &ndash; usually with some success.</p>

you are an inverted narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>To "qualify"
as an inverted narcissist &ndash; you must WANT to be in a
relationship with a narcissist, regardless of any abuse inflicted
on you by him/her. You must ACTIVELY seek relationships with
narcissists &ndash; and ONLY with narcissists &ndash; no matter
what your (bitter and traumatic) past experience has been. You
must feel EMPTY and UNHAPPY in relationships with ANY OTHER kind
of person. Only THEN &ndash; AND if you satisfy the other
diagnostic criteria of a Dependent Personality Disorder &ndash;
can you be safely labelled an "inverted narcissist".</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Introduction</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The DSM-IV uses 9 criteria to define the
NPD. It is sufficient to possess 5 of them to "qualify" as a
narcissist. Thus, theoretically, it is possible to be NPD WITHOUT
being grandiose. Many researchers (Alexander Lowen, Jeffrey
Satinover, Theodore Millon and others) suggested a "taxonomy" of
pathological narcissism. They divided narcissists to sub-groups
(very much as I did with my somatic versus cerebral narcissist
dichotomy &ndash; SV). Lowen, for instance, talks about the
"phallic" narcissist versus others. Satinover makes a very
important distinction between narcissists who were raised by
abusive parents &ndash; and those who were raised by doting and
smothering or domineering mothers. [See an expansion of the
Satinover classification in FAQ 36]</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Glenn O. Gabbard in "Psychodynamic
Psychiatry in Clinical Practice" [The DSM-IV Edition's. Comments
on Cluster B Personality Disorders &ndash; Narcissistic. American
Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1994] we find this:</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"...what definitive criteria can be used
to differentiate healthy from pathological narcissism? The time
honoured criteria of psychological health &ndash; to love and to
work &ndash; are only partly useful in answering this
question."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"An individual's work history may
provide little help in making the distinction. Highly disturbed
narcissistic individuals may find extraordinary success in
certain professions, such as big business, the arts, politics,
the entertainment industry, athletics and televangelism field. In
some cases, however, narcissistic pathology may be reflected in a
superficial quality to one's professional interests, as though
achievement in and acclaim are more important than mastery of the
field itself.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Pathological forms of narcissism are
more easily identified by the quality of the individual's
relationships.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">One tragedy affecting these people is
their inability to love. Healthy interpersonal relationships can
be recognised by qualities such as empathy and concern for the
feelings of others, a genuine interest in the ideas of others,
the ability to tolerate ambivalence in long-term relationships
without giving up, and a capacity to acknowledge one's own
contribution to interpersonal conflicts. People who are
characterised by these qualities may at times use others to
gratify their own needs, but the tendency occurs in the broader
context of sensitive interpersonal relatedness rather than as a
pervasive style of dealing with other people. One the other hand,
the person with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder approaches
people as objects to be used up and discarded according to his or
her needs, without regard for their feelings.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">People are not viewed as having a
separate existence or as having needs of their own. The
individual with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder frequently
ends a relationship after a short time, usually when the other
person begins to make demands stemming from for his or her own
needs. Most importantly, such relationships clearly do not 'work'
in terms of the narcissist's ability to maintain his or her own
sense of self-esteem."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"...These criteria [the DSM-IV's &ndash;
SV] identify a certain kind of narcissistic patient &ndash;
specifically, the arrogant, boastful, 'noisy' individual who
demands to be in the spotlight. However, they fail to
characterise the shy, quietly grandiose, narcissistic individual
whose extreme sensitivity to slights leads to an assiduous
avoidance of the spotlight."</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The DSM-III-R alluded to at least TWO TYPES
of narcissists, but the DSM-IV committee chose to delete this:
<i>"...included criterion, 'reacts to criticism with feelings of
rage, shame, or humiliation (even not if expressed)' due to lack
of 'specificity'."</i></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Other theoreticians, clinicians and
researchers similarly suggested a division between "the oblivious
narcissist" (a.k.a. overt) and "the hypervigilant narcissist"
(a.k.a. covert).</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Compensatory versus the Classic
Narcissist</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Another interesting distinction, suggested
by Dave Kelly in his excellent PTYPES web site
(http://www.ptypes.com) is between the Compensatory Type NPD and
the Classic NPD [DSM-IV type]:
http://www.geocities.com/ptyres/compensatory-narpd.html</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Here are the <b><i>Compensatory NPD
criteria</i></b> according to Dave Kelly:</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"Personality Types proposes Compensatory
Narcissistic Personality Disorder as a pervasive pattern of
unstable, covert narcissistic behaviours that derive from an
underlying sense of insecurity and weakness rather than from
genuine feelings of self-confidence and high self-esteem,
beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
contexts, as indicated by six (or more) of the criteria
below.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">The basic trait of the Compensatory
Narcissistic Personality Type is a pattern of overtly
narcissistic behaviours (that) derive from an underlying sense of
insecurity and weakness, rather than from genuine feelings of
self-confidence and high self-esteem."</span></i></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Inverted Narcissist</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It is clear that there is, indeed, an
hitherto neglected type of narcissist. It is the "self-effacing"
or "introverted" narcissist. We call it the Inverted Narcissist
(hereinafter: IN). Others call it "narcissist-codependent" or
"N-magnet".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>This is a
narcissist who, in many respects, is the mirror image of the
"classical" narcissist. No one is sure why. The psychodynamics of
such a narcissist are not clear, nor are his developmental roots.
Perhaps he is the product of an overweening Primary</span> <span
lang="EN-GB">Object or caregiver. Perhaps excessive abuse leads
to the repression of even the narcissistic and other defence
mechanisms. Perhaps the parents suppress every manifestation of
grandiosity (very common in early childhood) and of narcissism
&ndash; so that the narcissistic defence mechanism is "inverted"
and internalised in this unusual form.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">These narcissists are self-effacing,
sensitive, emotionally fragile, sometimes socially phobic. They
import all their self-esteem and sense of self-worth from the
outside (others), are pathologically envious (a transformation of
aggression), are likely to intermittently engage in
aggressive/violent behaviours, are more emotionally labile that
the classic narcissist, etc.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">We can, therefore talk about three "basic"
types of narcissists:</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The offspring of neglecting parents</i> &ndash; They
resort to narcissism as the predominant object relation (with
themselves as the exclusive object).</p>

<p>2. <i>The offspring of doting or domineering parents (often
narcissists themselves)</i> &ndash; They internalised their
parents' voices in the form of a sadistic, ideal, immature
Superego and spend their lives trying to be perfect, omnipotent,
omniscient and to be judged "a success" by these parent-images
and their later representations (authority figures).</p>

<p>3. <i>The offspring of abusive parents</i> &ndash; They
internalise the abusing, demeaning and contemptuous voices and
spend their lives in an effort to elicit "counter-voices" from
their human environment and thus to extract a modicum of
self-esteem and sense of self-worth.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">All three types exhibit recursive,
recurrent and Sisyphean failures. Shielded by their defence
mechanisms, they constantly gauge reality wrongly, their actions
and reactions become more and more rigid and ossified and the
damage inflicted by them on themselves and on others ever
greater.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissistic parent seems to employ a
myriad of primitive defences in his dealings with his children.
Splitting &ndash; idealising the child and devaluing him in
cycles, which reflect the internal dynamics of the parent rather
than anything the child does. Projective Identification &ndash;
forcing the child into behaviours and traits, which reflect the
parents' fears regarding himself or herself, his or her
self-image and his or her self-worth. This is a particularly
powerful and pernicious mechanism. If the narcissist parent fears
his own deficiencies ("defects"), vulnerability, perceived
weaknesses, susceptibility, gullibility, or emotions &ndash; he
is likely to force the child to "feel" these rejected and (to
him) repulsive emotions, to behave in ways strongly abhorred by
the parent, to exhibit character traits the parent strongly
rejects in himself. The child, in a way, becomes the "trash bin"
of the parents' inhibitions, fears, self-loathing, self-contempt,
perceived lack of self-worth, sense of inadequacy, rejected
traits, repressed emotions, failures and emotional reticence.
Coupled with parent's treatment of the child as the parent's
extension, it serves to totally inhibit the psychological growth
and emotional maturation of the child. The child becomes a
reflection of the parent &ndash; a vessel through which the
parent experiences and realises himself for better (hopes,
aspirations, ambition, life goals) and for worse (weaknesses,
"undesirable" emotions, "negative" traits). A host of other,
simpler, defence mechanisms put to use by the parent are likely
to obscure the predominant use of projective identification:
projection, displacement, intellectualisation, depersonalisation.
Relationships between such parents and their progeny easily
deteriorate to sexual or other modes of abuse because there are
no functioning boundaries between them.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It seems that the child's reaction to a
narcissistic parent can be either accommodation and assimilation
or rejection.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Accommodation and Assimilation</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The child accommodates, idealises and
internalises the Primary Object successfully. This means that the
child's "internal voice" is narcissistic and that the child tries
to comply with its directives and with its explicit and perceived
wishes. The child becomes a masterful provider of Narcissistic
Supply, a perfect match to the parent's personality, an ideal
source, an accommodating, understanding and caring caterer to all
the needs, whims, mood swings and cycles of the narcissist, an
endurer of devaluation and idealisation with equanimity, a superb
adapter to the narcissist's world view, in short: the ultimate
extension. This is what we call an "inverted
narcissist".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">We must not neglect the abusive aspect of
such a relationship. The narcissistic Primary Object always
alternates between idealisation of his progeny and its
devaluation. The child is likely to internalise the devaluing,
abusive, demeaning, berating, diminishing, minimising,
upbraiding, chastising voices. The parent (or caregiver) goes on
to survive inside the adult (as part of a sadistic and ideal
Superego and an unrealistic Ego Ideal, to resort to
psychoanalytic parlance). These are the voices that inhibit the
development of reactive narcissism, the child's defence
mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The adult maintains these traits. He keeps
looking for narcissists in order to feel whole, alive and wanted.
He wishes to be treated by a narcissist narcissistically (what
others would call abuse is, to him or her, familiar and
constitutes Narcissistic Supply). To him, the narcissist is a
Source of Supply (primary or secondary) and the narcissistic
behaviours constitute Narcissistic Supply. He feels dissatisfied,
empty and unloved if not loved by a narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The roles of Primary Source of Narcissistic
Supply (PSNS) and Secondary Source of Narcissistic Supply (SSNS)
are reversed. To the inverted narcissist, a spouse is a Source of
PRIMARY Supply, for instance.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The other reaction to the narcissistic
parent is:</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Rejection</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The child may react to the narcissism of
the Primary Object with a peculiar type of rejection. He develops
his own narcissistic personality, replete with grandiosity and
lack of empathy &ndash; BUT his personality is antithetical to
the personality of the narcissistic parent. If the parent were a
somatic narcissist &ndash; he is likely to be a cerebral one, if
his father prided himself being virtuous &ndash; he is sinful, if
his mother bragged about her frugality, he is bound to flaunt his
wealth.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">An Attempted DSM-Style List of
Criteria</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">We came up with a DSM-IV "style" inventory
for an inverted narcissist, using the narcissists'
characteristics as a template, because they are, in many ways two
sides of the same coin, or "the mould and the moulded" hence
"mirror narcissist" or "inverted narcissist".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist tries to merge with an
idealised but badly internalised object. He does so by
"digesting" the meaningful others in his life and transforming
them into extensions of his self. He employs various techniques
to achieve this. To the "digested" this is the crux of the
harrowing experience called "living with a
narcissist".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The "inverted narcissist" (IN), on the
other hand, does not attempt, except in fantasy or in dangerous,
masochistic sexual practice, to merge with an idealised external
object. This is because he so successfully internalised the
narcissistic Primary Object to the exclusion of all else. The IN
feels ill at ease in a relationship with a non-narcissist because
it is unconsciously perceived by him to be "betrayal",
"cheating", an abrogation of the exclusivity clause he had with
the narcissistic Primary Object.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This is the big difference between
narcissists and their inverted version. The former REJECTED the
Primary Object in particular (and object relations in general) in
favour of a handy substitute: themselves.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The IN accepted the (narcissist) Primary
Object and internalised it &ndash; to the exclusion of all others
(unless they are perceived by him to be faithful renditions,
replicas of the narcissistic Primary Object).</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion ONE</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">The IN possesses a rigid sense of lack
of self-worth.</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist has a badly regulated sense
of self-worth. However this is not conscious. He goes through
cycles of self-devaluation (and experiences them as dysphorias).
The IN's sense of self-worth does NOT fluctuate. It is rather
stable &ndash; but it is very low. Whereas the narcissist
devalues others &ndash; the IN devalues himself as an offering, a
sacrifice to the narcissist. The IN pre-empts the narcissist by
devaluing himself, by actively devaluing his own achievements, or
talents. The IN is exceedingly distressed when singled out
because of actual achievements or demonstration of superior
skills.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist is compelled to
filter all of his narcissistic needs through the primary
narcissist in their lives. No independence is permitted. The IN
feels amplified by the narcissist's commentary (because nothing
can be accomplished by the invert without the approval of a
primary narcissist in their lives).</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion TWO</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Pre-occupied with fantasies of unlimited
success, power, brilliance and beauty or of an ideal of
love.</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This is the same as the DSM-IV criterion
for Narcissistic Personality Disorder but, with the IN, it
manifests absolutely differently, i.e. the cognitive dissonance
is sharper here because the IN is so absolutely and completely
convinced of their worthlessness that these fantasies of grandeur
are extremely painful "dissonances".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">With the narcissist, the dissonance exists
on two levels:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Between the UNCONSCIOUS feeling of lack of
stable self-worth and the grandiose fantasies AND between the
grandiose fantasies and reality (the Grandiosity Gap).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In comparison, the inverted narcissist can
only vacillate between lack of self-worth and reality. No
grandiosity is permitted, except in dangerous, forbidden fantasy.
This shows that the invert is psychologically incapable of fully
realising their inherent potentials without a primary narcissist
to filter the praise, adulation or accomplishments through. They
MUST have someone to whom praise can be redirected. The
dissonance between the IN's certainty of self-worthlessness and
genuine praise that cannot be deflected is likely to emotionally
derail the inverted narcissist every time.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion THREE</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Believes that he is absolutely un-unique
and un-special (i.e., worthless and not worthy of merger with the
fantasised ideal) and that no one at all could understand him
because he is innately unworthy of being understood. The IN
becomes very agitated the more one tries to understand him
because that also offends against his righteous sense of being
properly excluded from the human race.</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A sense of worthlessness is typical of many
other PDs (AND the feeling that no one could ever understand
them). The narcissist himself endures prolonged periods of
self-devaluation, self-deprecation and self-effacement. This is
part of the Narcissistic Cycle. In this sense, the inverted
narcissist is a PARTIAL narcissist in that he is permanently
fixated in a part of the narcissist wheel, never to experience
its complementary half: the narcissistic grandiosity and sense of
entitlement.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The "righteous sense of being properly
excluded" comes from the sadistic Superego in concert with the
"overbearing, externally reinforced, conscience".</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion FOUR</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Demands anonymity (in the sense of
seeking to remain excluded at all costs) and is intensely
irritated and uncomfortable with any attention being paid to him
&ndash; similar to the Schizoid PD.</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion FIVE</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Feels that he is undeserving and not
entitled.</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Feels that he is inferior to others,
lacking, insubstantial, unworthy, unlikeable, unlovable, someone
to scorn and dismiss, or to ignore.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion SIX</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Is extinguishingly selfless,
sacrificial, even unctuous in his interpersonal relationships and
will avoid the assistance of others at all costs. Can only
interact with others when he can be seen to be giving,
supportive, and expending an unusual effort to
assist.</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Some narcissists behave the same way but
only as a means to obtain Narcissistic Supply (praise, adulation,
affirmation, attention). This must not be confused with the
behaviour of the IN.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion SEVEN</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Lacks empathy. Is intensely attuned to
others' needs, but only in so far as it relates to his own need
to perform the required self-sacrifice, which in turn is
necessary in order for the IN to obtain his Narcissistic Supply
from the primary narcissist.</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">By contrast, narcissists are never
empathic. They are intermittently attuned to others only in order
to optimise the extraction of Narcissistic Supply from
them.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion EIGHT</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Envies others. Cannot conceive of being
envied and becomes extremely agitated and uncomfortable if even
brought into a situation where comparison might occur &ndash;
loathes competition and will avoid competition at all costs, if
there is any chance of actually winning the competition, or being
singled out.</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Criterion NINE</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Displays extreme shyness, lack of any
real relational connections, is publicly self-effacing in the
extreme, is internally highly moralistic and critical of others;
is a perfectionist and engages in lengthy ritualistic behaviours,
which can never be perfectly performed (obsessive-compulsive,
though not necessarily to the full extent exhibited in OCD).
Notions of being individualistic are anathema.</span></i></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Reactive Patterns of the Inverted
Narcissist (IN)</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist does not suffer
from a "milder" form of narcissism. Like the "classic"
narcissists, it has degrees and shades. But it is much more rare
and the DSM-IV variety is the more prevalent.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist is liable to react
with rage whenever threatened, or&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&hellip;When envious of other people's
achievements, their ability to feel wholeness, happiness, rewards
and successes, when his sense of self-worthlessness is enhanced
by a behaviour, a comment, an event, when his lack of self-worth
and voided self-esteem is THREATENED. Thus, this type of
narcissist might surprisingly react violently or rage-fully to
GOOD things: a kind remark, a mission accomplished, a reward, a
compliment, a proposition, a sexual advance).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&hellip;When thinking about the past, when
emotions and memories are evoked (usually negative ones) by
certain music, a given smell, or sight.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&hellip;When his pathological envy leads to
an all-pervasive sense of injustice and being discriminated
against or treated unjustly by a spiteful world.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&hellip;When he encounters stupidity,
avarice, dishonesty, bigotry &ndash; it is these qualities in him
that the narcissist really fears and rejects so vehemently in
others.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&hellip;When he believes that he failed
(and he always entertains this belief), that he is imperfect and
useless and worthless, a good for nothing half-baked
creature.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">&hellip;When he realises to what extent his
inner demons possess him, constrain his life, torment him, deform
him and the hopelessness of it all.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Then even the inverted narcissist rages. He
becomes verbally and emotionally abusive. He abuses unfairly
confidences. He uncannily pierces the soft spots of his target,
and mercilessly drives home the poisoned dagger of despair and
self-loathing until it infects his adversary.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The calm after such a storm is even eerier,
a thundering silence. The narcissist regrets his behaviour but
rarely admit his feelings, though he might apologise
profusely.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">He simply nurtures his feelings as yet
another weapon of self-destruction and self-defeat. It is from
this very suppressed self-contempt, from this very repressed and
introverted judgement, from this missing emotional atonement that
the narcissistic rage springs forth. Thus the vicious cycle is
established.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">One important difference between inverted
narcissists and non-narcissists is that the former are less
likely to react with PTSD (Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome)
following a relationship with a narcissist. They seem to be
"desensitised" to narcissists by their early upbringing. Whereas
the reactions of normal people to narcissistic behaviour patterns
(and especially to the splitting and projective identification
defence mechanisms and to the idealisation devaluation cycles) is
shock, profound hurt and disorientation &ndash; inverted
narcissists show none of the above.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Life of the Inverted Narcissist
(IN)</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The IN is, usually, exceedingly and
painfully shy as a child. Despite this social phobia, his
grandiosity (absorbed from the parent) might direct him to seek
"limelight" professions and occupations, which involve exposure,
competition, "stage fright" and social friction. The setting can
vary from the limited (family) to the expansive (national media)
&ndash; but, whatever it is, the result is constant conflict and
feelings of discomfort, even terror and extreme excitement and
thrill ("adrenaline rush"). This is because the IN's grandiosity
is "imported" and not fully integrated. It is, therefore, not
supportive of his "grandiose" pursuits (as is the case with the
narcissist). On the contrary, the IN feels awkward, pitted on the
edge of a precipice, contrived, false and misleading, not to say
deceitful.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist grows up in a
suppressive environment. It could be an orthodox,
hyper-religious, or traditionalist culture, a monovalent, "black
and white", doctrinarian and indoctrinating society &ndash; or a
family which manifests all the above in a microcosm all its own.
The inverted narcissist is cast in a negative (emergent) role
within his family. His "negativity" is attributed to his gender,
the order of his birth, religious, social, or cultural dictates
and commandments, his "character flaws", his relation to a
specific person or event, his acts or inaction and so
on.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the words of one such IN:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">"In the religious culture I grew up in.
Women are SO suppressed, their roles are so carefully restricted.
They are the representation, in the flesh, of all that is sinful,
degrading, of all that is wrong with the world.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">These are the negative gender/cultural
images that were force fed to us the negative 'otherness' of
women, as defined by men, was fed to me. I was so shy, withdrawn,
unable to really relate to people at all from as early as I can
remember."</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The IN is subjected and exposed either to
an overbearing, overvalued parent, or to an aloof, detached,
emotionally unavailable one &ndash; or to both &ndash; at an
early stage of his life.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">"I grew up in the shadow of my father who
adored me, put me on a pedestal, told me I could do or be
anything I wanted because I was incredibly bright, BUT, he ate me
alive, I was his property and an extension of him. I also grew up
with the mounting hatred of my narcissist brother who got none of
this attention from our father and got no attention from our
mother either. My function was to make my father look wonderful
in the eyes of all outsiders, the wonderful parent with a genius
Wunderkind as his last child, and the only child of the six that
he was physically present to raise from the get go. The
overvaluation combined with being abjectly ignored or raged at by
him when I stepped out of line even the tiniest bit, was enough
to warp my personality."</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The invert cannot, or is prevented from
developing full-blown secondary narcissism. The invert is so
heavily preoccupied in his or her pre-school years in satisfying
the narcissistic parent, that the traits of grandiosity and
self-love, need for adoration and Narcissistic Supply from ANY
viable source remain dormant or repressed.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The invert simply "knows" that only the
narcissistic parent can provide the requisite amount of
Narcissistic Supply. The narcissistic parent is so controlling
that any attempt to garner praise or adulation from any other
source (without the approval of the parent) is severely punished
by swift devaluation and even the occasional spanking or abuse
(physical, emotional, or sexual).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This is a vital part of the conditioning
that gives rise to inverted narcissism. Where the narcissist
exhibits grandiosity, the invert is intensely uncomfortable with
personal praise, and wishes to always divert praise away from
himself onto his narcissist. This is why the IN can only truly
FEEL anything when he is in relationship with another narcissist.
The IN is conditioned and programmed from the very beginning to
be the perfect companion to the narcissist. To feed their Ego, to
be purely their extension, to seek only praise and adulation if
it brings greater praise and adulation to the
narcissist.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Inverted Narcissist's Survival
Guide</span></h3>

<p>&bull; Listen attentively to everything the narcissist says
and agree with it all. Don't believe a word of it but let it
slide as if everything is just fine, business as usual.</p>

<p>&bull; Offer something absolutely unique to the narcissist
which they cannot obtain anywhere else.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Also be prepared to line up future Sources
of Primary NS for your narcissist because you will not be IT for
very long, if at all. If you take over the procuring function for
the narcissist, they become that much more dependent on you which
makes it a bit tougher for them to pull their haughty stuff
&ndash; an inevitability, in any case.</span></p>

<p>&bull; Be endlessly patient and go way out of your way to be
accommodating, thus keeping the Narcissistic Supply flowing
liberally, and keeping the peace (relatively speaking).</p>

<p>&bull; Get tremendous personal satisfaction out of endlessly
giving. This one may not be attractive to you, but it is a take
it or leave it proposition.</p>

<p>&bull; Be absolutely emotionally and financially independent
of the narcissist. Take what you need: the excitement and
engulfment (i.e., NS) and refuse to get upset or hurt when the
narcissist does or says something dumb. Yelling back works really
well but should be reserved for special occasions when you fear
your narcissist may be on the verge of leaving you; the silent
treatment is better as an ordinary response, but it must be
devoid of emotional content, more with the air of boredom and
"I'll talk to you later, when I am good and ready, and when you
are behaving in a more reasonable fashion."</p>

<p>&bull; If your narcissist is cerebral and NOT interested in
having much sex &ndash; then give yourself ample permission to
have sex with other people. Your cerebral narcissist will not be
indifferent to infidelity so discretion and secrecy is of
paramount importance.</p>

<p>&bull; If your narcissist is somatic and you don't mind, join
in on endlessly interesting group sex encounters but make sure
that you choose properly for your narcissist. They are heedless
and very undiscriminating in respect of sexual partners and that
can get very problematic (STDs and blackmail come to mind).</p>

<p>&bull; If you are a "fixer" which most inverted narcissists
are, then focus on fixing situations, preferably before they
become "situations". Don't for one moment delude yourself that
you can FIX the narcissist &ndash; it simply will not happen. Not
because they are being stubborn &ndash; they just simply can't be
fixed.</p>

<p>&bull; If there is any fixing that can be done, it is to help
your narcissist become aware of their condition, and this is VERY
IMPORTANT, with no negative implications or accusations in the
process at all. It is like living with a physically handicapped
person and being able to discuss, calmly, unemotionally, what the
limitations and benefits of the handicap are and how the two of
you can work with these factors, rather than trying to change
them.</p>

<p>&bull; FINALLY, and most important of all for the inverted
narcissist: KNOW YOURSELF.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">What are you getting from the relationship?
Are you actually a masochist?</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Why is this relationship attractive and
interesting?</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Define for yourself what good and
beneficial things you believe you are receiving in this
relationship. Define the things that you find harmful TO YOU.
Develop strategies to minimise the harm to yourself. Don't expect
that you will cognitively be able to reason with the narcissist
to change who they are. You may have some limited success in
getting your narcissist to tone down on the really harmful
behaviours THAT AFFECT YOU, which emanate from the unchangeable
WHAT the narcissist is. This can only be accomplished in a very
trusting, frank and open relationship.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">We firmly believe that it is only the
inverted narcissist who can have a reasonably good, long lasting
relationship with the narcissist. You must be prepared to give
your narcissist a LOT of space and leeway.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">You don't really exist for them as a fully
realised person &ndash; no one does. They are not fully realised
people so they cannot possibly have the skills, no matter how
smart or sexy, to be a complete person in the sense that most
adults are complete.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Somatic versus Cerebral Inverted
Narcissists (IN)</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist is really an
erstwhile narcissist internalised by the IN. Inevitably, we are
likely to find among the inverted the same propensities,
predilections, preferences and inclinations as we do among proper
narcissists.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The cerebral IN is an IN whose source of
vicarious Primary Narcissistic Supply lies &ndash; through the
medium and mediation of a narcissist &ndash; in the exercise of
his intellectual faculties. A somatic IN would tend to make use
of his body, sex, shape or health in trying to secure NS for
"his" narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist feeds on the
primary narcissist and this is his Narcissistic Supply. So these
two typologies can, in essence become a self-supporting,
symbiotic system. In reality though, both the narcissist and the
inverted narcissist need to be quite well aware of the dynamics
of this relationship in order to make this work as a successful
long-term arrangement. It might well be that this symbiosis would
only work between a cerebral narcissist and a cerebral invert.
The somatic narcissist's capricious sexual dalliances would be
far too threatening to the equanimity of the cerebral invert for
there to be much chance of this succeeding, even for a short
time.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It would seem that only opposing types of
narcissists can get along when two classic narcissists are
involved in a couple. It follows, syllogistically, that only
identical types of narcissist and inverted narcissist can survive
in a couple. In other words: the best, most enduring couples of
narcissist and his inverted narcissist mate would involve a
somatic narcissist and a somatic IN &ndash; or a cerebral
narcissist and a cerebral IN.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Coping with Narcissists and
Non-Narcissists</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist is a person who
grew up enthralled by the narcissistic parent. This parent
engulfed and subsumed the child's being to such an over-bearing
extent that the child's personality was irrevocably shaped by
this engulfment, damaged beyond hope of repair. The child was not
even able to develop defence mechanisms such as
narcissism.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The end result is an inverted narcissistic
personality. The traits of this personality are primarily evident
in relationship contexts. The child was conditioned by the
narcissistic parent to only be entitled to feel whole, useful,
productive, complete when the child augmented or mirrored to the
parent their own sought after narcissistic image. As a result the
child is shaped by this engulfment and cannot feel complete in
any significant adult relationship unless they are with a
narcissist.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">The Inverted Narcissist in Relationship
with the Narcissist</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist is drawn to
significant relationships with other narcissists in his
adulthood. These relationships are usually spousal primary
relationships but can also be friendships with narcissists
outside of the primary love relationship.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In a primary relationship, the inverted
narcissist attempts to re-create the parent-child relationship.
The invert thrives on mirroring to the narcissist his own
grandiosity and in so doing the invert obtains his OWN
Narcissistic Supply (the dependence of the narcissist upon the
invert for their Secondary Narcissistic Supply). The invert must
have this form of relationship with a narcissist in order to feel
complete and whole. The invert will go as far as he needs to
ensure that the narcissist is happy, cared for, properly adored,
as he feels is the narcissist's right. The invert glorifies his
narcissist, places him on a pedestal, endures any and all
narcissistic devaluation with calm equanimity, impervious to the
overt slights of the narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Narcissistic rage is handled deftly by the
inverted narcissist. The invert is exceedingly adept at managing
every aspect of his life, tightly controlling all situations, so
as to minimise the potential for the inevitable narcissistic
rages of his narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The invert wishes to be subsumed by the
narcissist. The invert only feels truly loved and alive in this
kind of relationship. The invert is loth to abandon his
relationships with narcissists. The relationship only ends when
the narcissist withdraws completely from the symbiosis. Once the
narcissist has determined that the invert is of no further use,
and withholds all Narcissistic Supply from the invert, only then
does the invert reluctantly move on to another relationship. The
invert is most likely to equate sexual intimacy with engulfment.
This can be easily misread to mean that the invert is himself or
herself a somatic narcissist, but it would be incorrect. The
invert can endure years of minimal sexual contact with their
narcissist and still be able to maintain the self-delusion of
intimacy and engulfment. The invert finds a myriad of other ways
to "merge" with the narcissist, becoming intimately, though only
in support roles, involved with the narcissist's business,
career, or any other activity where the invert can feel that they
are needed by the narcissist and indispensable. The invert is an
expert at doling out Narcissistic Supply and even goes as far as
procuring Primary Narcissistic Supply for their narcissist (even
where this means finding another lover for the narcissist, or
participating in group sex with the narcissist). Usually though,
the invert seems most attracted to the cerebral narcissist and
finds him easier to manage than the somatic narcissist. The
cerebral narcissist is disinterested in sex and this makes life
considerably easier for the invert, i.e., the invert is less
likely to "lose" their cerebral narcissist to another primary
partner. A somatic narcissist may be prone to changing partners
with greater frequency or wish to have no partner, preferring to
have multiple, casual sexual relationships of no apparent depth
which never last very long.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The invert regards relationships with
narcissists as the ONLY true and legitimate form of primary
relationship. The invert is capable of having primary
relationships with non-narcissists. But without engulfment, the
invert feels unneeded, unwanted and emotionally
uninvolved.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Relationships between the</span></h4>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Inverted Narcissist and
Non-Narcissists</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The inverted narcissist can maintain
relationships outside of the symbiotic primary relationship with
a narcissist. But the invert does not "feel" loved because the
non-narcissist is not "engulfing" them. Thus, the invert tends to
devalue their non-narcissistic primary partner as less than
worthy of the inverts' love and attention.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The invert may be able to sustain a
relationship with a non-narcissist by finding other narcissistic
symbiotic relationships outside of this primary relationship. The
invert may have a narcissistic friend, to whom he pays
extraordinary attention, ignoring the real needs of the
non-narcissistic partner.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consequently, the only semi-stable primary
relationship between the invert and the non-narcissist occurs
where the non-narcissist is very easy going, emotionally secure
and not needing much from the invert at all by way of time,
energy or commitment to activities requiring the involvement of
both parties. In a relationship with this kind of narcissist, the
invert may become a workaholic or very involved in outside
activities that exclude the non-narcissist spouse.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It appears that the inverted narcissist in
a relationship with a non-narcissist is behaviourally
indistinguishable from a true narcissist. The only important
exception is that the invert does not rage at his non-narcissist
partner &ndash; he instead withdraws from the relationship even
further. This passive-aggressive reaction has been noted, though,
with narcissists as well.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Inverted Narcissists Talk about
Themselves</span></h3>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Competition and (Pathological)
Envy</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I have a dynamic that comes up with
every single person I get close to, where I feel extremely
competitive toward and envious of the other person. But I don't
ACT competitive, because at the very outset, I see myself as the
loser in the competition. I would never dream of trying to beat
the other person, because I know deep in my heart that they would
win and I would be utterly humiliated. There are fewer things on
earth that feel worse to me than losing a contest and having the
other person gloat over me, especially if they know how much I
cared about not losing. This is one thing that I actually feel
violent about. I guess I tend to project the grandiosity part of
the NPD package onto the other person rather than on a False Ego
of my own. So most of the time I'm stuck in a state of deep
resentment and envy toward her. To me, she's always far more
intelligent, likable, popular, talented, self-confident,
emotionally developed, morally good, and attractive than I am.
And I really hate her for that, and feel humiliated by it. So
it's incredibly hard for me to feel happy for this person when
she has a success, because I'm overcome with humiliation about
myself. This has ruined many a close relationship. I tend to get
this way about one person at a time, usually the person who is
playing the role of 'my better half', best friends or
lovers/partners. So it's not like I'm unable to be happy for
anyone, ever, or that I envy every person I meet. I don't get
obsessed with how rich or beautiful movie stars are or anything
like that. It only gets projected onto this partner-person, the
person I'm depending on the most in terms of supplies (attention,
reassurance, security, building up my self-esteem,
etc.)...</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">...The really destructive thing that
happens is, I see her grandiose traits as giving her the power to
have anything and anyone she wants. So I feel a basic insecurity,
because why should she stay with a loser like me, when she's
obviously so out of my league? So really, what I'm envious of is
the power that all that talent, social ability, beauty, etc.,
gives her to have CHOICES &ndash; the choice to stay or leave me.
Whereas I am utterly dependent on her. It's this emotional
inequality that I find so humiliating."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I agree with the inverted narcissist
designation &ndash; sometimes I've called myself a 'closet
narcissist'. That is, I've internalised the value system of
grandiosity, but have not applied the grandiose identity to
myself.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">I believe I SHOULD BE those grandiose
things, but at the same time, I know I'm not and I'm miserable
about it. So people don't think of me as having an inflated Ego
&ndash; and indeed I don't &ndash; but scratch the surface, and
you'll find all these inflated expectations. I mean to say that
perhaps the parents suppressed every manifestation of grandiosity
(very common in early childhood) and of narcissism &ndash; so
that the defence mechanism that narcissism is was 'inverted' and
internalised in this unusual form."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"Maybe there aren't two discrete states
(NPD vs. 'regular' low self-esteem) &ndash; maybe it's more of a
continuum. And maybe it's just the degree and depth of the
problem that distinguishes one from the other.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">My therapist describes NPD as 'the
inability to love oneself'. As she defines it, the 'narcissistic
wound' is a deep wounding of the sense of self, the image of
oneself. That doesn't mean that other disorders &ndash; or for
that matter, other life stressors &ndash; can't also cause low
self-esteem. But I think NPD IS low self-esteem...</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">That's what the disorder is really about
&ndash; an image of yourself that is profoundly negative, and the
inability to attain a normal and healthy
self-image..."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"Yes, I'm a survivor of child abuse. But
remember that not all abuse is alike. There are different kinds
of abuse, and different effects. My XXX's style of abuse had to
do with trying to annihilate me as a separate person. It also had
to do with the need to put all his negative self-image onto me
&ndash; to see in me what he hated in himself. So I got to play
the role of the loser that he secretly feared he was. I was
flipped back and forth in those roles &ndash; sometimes I'd be a
Source of NS for him, and other times I was the receptacle of all
his pain and rage. Sometimes my successes were used to reflect
back on him, to show off to the rest of the family. Other times,
my successes were threatening to my father, who suddenly feared
that I was superior to him and had to be squelched. I experience
emotions that most people I know don't feel. Or maybe they do
feel them, but to far less extreme intensity. For example, the
envy and comparison/competition I feel toward others. I guess
most of us have experienced rivalry, jealousy, being compared to
others. Most of us have felt envy at another's success. Yet most
people I know seem able to overcome those feelings to some
extent, to be able to function normally. In a competition, for
example, they may be driven to do their best so they can win. For
me, the fear of losing and being humiliated is so intense that I
avoid competition completely. I am terrified of showing people
that I care about doing well, because it's so shaming for me if I
lose. So I underachieve and pretend I don't care. Most people I
know may envy another person's good luck or success, but it
doesn't prevent them from also being happy for them and
supporting them. But for me, when I'm in a competitive dynamic
with someone, I can't hear about any of their successes, or
compliments they've received, etc. I don't even like to see the
person doing good things, like bringing Thanksgiving leftovers to
the sick old guy next door, because those things make me feel
inferior for not thinking of doing that myself (and not having
anyone in my life that I'd do that for). It's just so incredibly
painful for me to see evidence of the other person's good
qualities, because it immediately brings up my feeling of
inferiority. I can't even stand to date someone, who looks really
good, because I'm jealous of their good looks! So this deep and
obsessive envy has destroyed my joy in other people. All the
things about other people that I love and take pleasure in is a
double-edged sword because I also hate them for it, for having
those good qualities (while, presumably, I don't). I don't know
&ndash; do you think this is garden-variety low self-esteem? I
know plenty of people who suffer from lack of confidence, from
timidity, social awkwardness, hatred of their body, feeling
unlovable, etc. But they don't have this kind of hostile,
corrosive resentment of another person for being all the
wonderful things that they can't be, or aren't allowed to be,
etc. And one thing I hate is when people are judgemental of me
about how I feel, as though I can help it. It's like, 'You
shouldn't be so selfish, you should feel happy for her that she's
successful', etc. They don't understand that I would love to feel
those things, but I can't. I can't stop the incredible pain that
explodes in me when these feelings get triggered, and I often
can't even HIDE the feelings. It's just so overwhelming. I feel
so damaged sometimes. There's more, but that's the crux of it for
me, anyway."</span></i></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Getting Compliments</span></h3>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I love getting compliments and rewards,
and do not react negatively to them. In some moods, when my
self-hate has gotten triggered, I can sometimes get to places
where I'm inconsolable, because I get stuck in bitterness and
self-pity, and so I doubt the sincerity or the reliability of the
good thing that someone is saying to me (to try to cheer me up or
whatever). But, if I'm in a reasonable mood and someone offers me
something good, I'm all too happy to accept it! I don't have a
stake in staying miserable."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">The Partiality of the
Condition</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I do agree that it's (atypical or
inverted narcissism) not MILDER. But how I see it is that it's
PARTIAL. The part that's there is just as destructive as it is in
the typical narcissist. But there are parts missing from that
total, full-blown disorder &ndash; and I see that as healthy,
actually. I see it as parts of myself that WEREN'T infected by
the pathology, that are still intact.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">In my case, I did not develop the
overweening Ego part of the disorder. So in a sense, what you
have with me is the naked pathology, with no covering: no
suaveness, no charm, no charisma, no confidence, no
persuasiveness, but also no excuses, no lies, no justifications
for my feelings. Just the ugly self-hate, for all to see. And the
self-hate part is just as bad as it is with a full-blown
narcissist, so again, it's not milder.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">But because I don't have the denial part
of the disorder, I have a lot more insight, a lot more motivation
to do something about my problems (i.e., I 'self-refer' to
therapy), and therefore, I think, a lot more hope of getting
better than people whose defence involves totally denying they
even have a problem."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"When my full-blown XXX's pathological
envy would get triggered, he would respond by putting down the
person he was envious of &ndash; or by putting down the
accomplishment itself, or whatever good stuff the other person
had. He'd trivialise it, or outright contradict it, or find some
way to convince the other person (often me) that the thing
they're feeling good about isn't real, or isn't worthwhile, or is
somehow bad, etc. He could do this because the inflated Ego
defence was fully formed and operating with him.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">When MY pathological envy gets
triggered, I will be bluntly honest about it. I'll say something
self-pitying, such as: 'You always get the good stuff, and I get
nothing'; 'You're so much better than I'; 'People like you better
&ndash; you have good social skills and I'm a jerk'; and so on.
Or I might even get hostile and sarcastic: 'Well, it must be nice
to have so many people worshipping you, isn't it?' I don't try to
convince myself that the other person's success isn't real or
worthwhile, etc. Instead, I'm totally flooded with the pain of
feeling utterly inferior and worthless &ndash; and there's no way
for me to convince myself or anyone else otherwise. I'm not
saying that the things I say are pleasant to hear &ndash; and it
is still manipulative of me to say them, because the other
person's attention is drawn away from their joy and onto my pain
and hostility. And instead of doubting their success's worth or
reality, they feel guilty about it, or about talking about it,
because it hurts me so much. So from the other person's point of
view, maybe it's not any easier to live with a partial narcissist
than with a full-blown, in that their joys and successes lead to
pain in both cases. It's certainly not easier for me, being
flooded with rage and pain instead of being able to hide behind a
delusion of grandeur. But from my therapist's point of view, I'm
much better off because I know I'm unhappy &ndash; it's in my
face all the time. So I'm motivated to work on it and change it.
And time has borne her words out. Over the past several years
that I've worked on this issue, I have changed a great deal in
how I deal with it. Now when the envy gets triggered, I don't
feel so entwined with the other person &ndash; I recognise that
it's my OWN pain getting triggered, not something they are doing
to me. And so I can acknowledge the pain in a more responsible
way, taking ownership of it by saying, 'The jealousy feelings are
getting triggered again, and I'm feeling worthless and inferior.
Can you reassure me that I'm not?' That's a lot better than
making some snide, hostile, or self-pitying comment that puts the
other person on the defensive or makes them feel guilty... I do
prefer the term 'partial' because that's what it feels like to
me. It's like a building that's partially built &ndash; the house
of narcissism. For me, the structure is there, but not the
outside, so you can see inside the skeleton to all the junk
that's inside. It's the same junk that's inside a full-blown
narcissist, but their building is completed, so you can't see
inside. Their building is a fortress, and it's almost impossible
to bring it down. My defences aren't as strong ... which makes my
life more difficult in some ways because I REALLY feel my pain.
But it also means that the house can be brought down more easily,
and the junk inside cleaned out..."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Thinking about the Past and the
World</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I don't usually get rageful about the
past. I feel sort of emotionally cut-off from the past, actually.
I remember events very clearly, but usually can't remember the
feelings. When I do remember the feelings, my reaction is usually
one of sadness, and sometimes of relief that I can get back in
touch with my past. But not rage. All my rage seems to get
displaced on the current people in my life."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"...When I see someone being really
socially awkward and geeky, passive-aggressive, indirect and
victim-like, it does trigger anger in me because I identify with
that person and I don't want to. I try to put my negative
feelings onto them, to see that person as the jerk, not me
&ndash; that's what a narcissist does, after all. But for me it
doesn't completely work because I know, consciously, what I'm
trying to do. And ultimately, I'm not kidding anyone, least of
all myself."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Self-Pity and Depression</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"More self-pity and depression here
&ndash; not so much rage. One of the things that triggers my rage
more than anything else is the inability to control another
person, the inability to dominate them and force my reality on
them. I feel impotent, humiliated, forced back on my empty self.
Part of what I'm feeling here is envy: that person who can't be
controlled clearly has a self and I don't, and I just hate them
for it. But it's also a power struggle &ndash; I want to get
Narcissistic Supply by being in control and on top and having the
other person submissive and compliant..."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Regretting, Admitting Mistakes</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I regret my behaviour horribly, and I
DO admit my feelings. I am also able, in the aftermath, to have
empathy for the feelings of the person I've hurt, and I'm
horribly sad about it, and ashamed of myself. It's as though I'd
been possessed by a demon, acted out all this abusive horrible
stuff, and then, after the departure of the demon, I'm back in my
right mind and it's like, 'What have I DONE???' I don't mean I'm
not responsible for what I did (i.e., a demon made me do it). But
when I'm triggered, I have no empathy &ndash; I can only see my
projection onto that person, as a huge threat to me, someone who
must be demolished. But when my head clears, I see that person's
pain, hurt, fear &ndash; and I feel terrible. I want to make it
up to them. And that feeling is totally sincere &ndash; it's not
an act. I'm genuinely sorry for the pain I've caused the other
person."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Rage</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I wouldn't say that my rage comes from
repressed self-contempt (mine is not repressed &ndash; I'm
totally aware of it). And it's not missing atonement either,
since I do atone. The rage comes from feeling humiliated, from
feeling that the other person has somehow sadistically and
gleefully made me feel inferior, that they're getting off on
being superior, that they're mocking me and ridiculing me, that
they have scorn and contempt for me and find it all very amusing.
That &ndash; whether real or imagined (usually imagined) &ndash;
is what causes my rage."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Pursuing Relationships with
Narcissists</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"There are some very few of us who
actually seek out relationships with narcissists. We do this with
the full knowledge that we are not wanted, despised even. We
persist and pursue no matter the consequences, no matter the
cost. I am an 'inverted narcissist'. It is because as a child I
was 'imprinted/fixated' with a particular pattern involving
relationships. I was engulfed so completely by my father's
personality and repressed so severely by various other factors in
my childhood that I simply didn't develop a recognisable
personality. I existed purely as an extension of my father. I was
his genius Wunderkind. He ignored my mother and poured all his
energy and effort into me. I did not develop full-blown secondary
narcissism... I developed into the perfect 'other half' of the
narcissists moulding me. I became the perfect, eager
co-dependent. And this is an imprint, a pattern in my psyche, a
way of (not) relating to the world of relationships by only being
able to truly relate to one person (my father) and then one kind
of person &ndash; the narcissist. He is my perfect lover, my
perfect mate, a fit that is so slick and smooth, so comfortable
and effortless, so filled with meaning and actual feelings
&ndash; that's the other thing. I cannot feel on my own. I am
incomplete. I can only feel when I am engulfed by another (first
it was my father) and now &ndash; well now it has to be a
narcissist. Not just any narcissist either. He must be
exceedingly smart, good looking, have adequate reproductive
equipment and some knowledge on how to use it and that's about
it. When I am engulfed by someone like this I feel completed, I
can actually FEEL. I am whole again. I function as a sibyl, an
oracle, an extension of the narcissist. His fiercest protector,
his purveyor/procurer of NS, the secretary, organiser, manager,
etc. I think you get the picture and this gives me INTENSE
PLEASURE.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">So the answer to your question: 'Why
would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want them back?'
The short answer is, 'Because there is no one else remotely worth
looking at.'"</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Making Amends</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I mostly apologise, and I give the
person space to talk about what hurt them so that (1) they get to
express their anger or hurt to me, and (2) I can understand
better and know better how not to hurt them (if I can avoid it)
the next time there's a conflict. Sometimes the hurt I cause is
unintentional &ndash; maybe I've been insensitive or forgetful or
something, in which case I feel more certain that I can avoid
repeating the hurtful behaviour, since I didn't want to hurt them
in the first place. If the hurt I caused has to do with my
getting my trigger pulled and going into a rage, then that hurt
was quite deliberate, although at the time I was unable to
experience the other person as vulnerable or capable of being
hurt by me. And I do realise that if that trigger is pulled
again, it might happen again. But I also hope that there'll be a
LITTLE TINY window where the memory of the conversation will come
back to me while I'm in my rage, and I'll remember that the
person really IS vulnerable. I hope that by hearing over and over
that the person actually does feel hurt by what I say while in
rages, that I might remember that when I am triggered and raging.
So, mostly I apologise and try to communicate with the other
person. I don't verbally self-flagellate, because that's
manipulative. Not to say I never do that &ndash; in fact I've had
a dynamic with people where I verbally put myself down and try to
engage the other person into arguing me out of it.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">But if I'm in the middle of apologising
to the other person for hurting them, then I feel like this is
their moment, and I don't want to turn the focus toward getting
them to try to make me feel better. I will talk about myself, but
only in an attempt to communicate, so that we can understand each
other better. I might say, 'I got triggered about such-and-such,
and you seemed so invulnerable that it enraged me', etc. &ndash;
and the other person might react with, 'But I was feeling
vulnerable, I just couldn't show it', etc. &ndash; and we'll go
back and forth like that. So it's not like I don't think my
feelings count, and I do want the other person to UNDERSTAND my
feelings, but I don't want to put the other person in the role of
taking care of my feelings in that moment, because they have just
been hurt by me and I'm trying to make it up to them, not squeeze
more stuff OUT of them..."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"So when I've been a real jerk to
someone, I want them to feel like it's OK to be pissed off at me,
and I want them to know that I am interested in and focused on
how they feel, not just on how I feel. As for gifts &ndash; I
used to do that, but eventually I came to feel that that was
manipulative, too, that it muddled things because then the other
person would feel like they couldn't be angry anymore, since
after all, I've just brought them this nice gift. I also feel
that in general, gift-giving is a sweet and tender thing to do,
and I don't want to sully that tenderness by associating it with
the hurt that comes from abusive behaviour."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Why Narcissists?</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I am BUILT this way. I may have
overstated it by saying that I have 'no choice' because, in fact
I do.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">The choice is &ndash; live in an
emotionally deadened monochrome world where I can reasonably
interact with normal people OR I can choose to be with a
narcissist in which case my world is Technicolor, emotionally
satisfying, alive and wondrous (also can be turbulent and a real
roller coaster ride for the unprepared, not to mention incredibly
damaging for people who are not inverted narcissists and who fall
into relationships with narcissists). As I have walked on both
sides of the street, and because I have developed coping
mechanisms that protect me really quite well, I can reasonably
safely engage in a primary, intimate relationship with a
narcissist without getting hurt by it.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">The real WHY of it all is that I
learned, as a young child, that being 'eaten alive' by a
narcissist parent, to the point where your existence is but an
extension of his own, was how all relationships ought to work. It
is a psychological imprint &ndash; my 'love map', it is what
feels right to me intrinsically. A pattern of living &ndash; I
don't know how else to describe it so you and others will
understand how very natural and normal this is for me. It is not
the torturous existence that most of the survivors of narcissism
are recounting on this list.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">My experiences with narcissists, to me,
ARE NORMAL for me. Comfortable like an old pair of slippers that
fit perfectly. I don't expect many people to attempt to do this,
to 'make themselves into' this kind of person. I don't think
anyone could, if they tried.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">It is my need to be engulfed and merged
that drives me to these relationships and when I get those needs
met I feel more normal, better about myself. I am the outer
extension of the narcissist. In many ways I am a vanguard, a
public two-way warning system, fiercely defending my narcissist
from harm, and fiercely loyal to him, catering to his every need
in order to protect his fragile existence. These are the dynamics
of my particular version of engulfment. I don't need anyone to
take care of me. I need only to be needed in this very particular
way, by a narcissist who inevitably possesses the ability to
engulf in a way that normal, fully realised adults cannot. It is
somewhat paradoxical &ndash; I feel freer and more independent
with a narcissist than without one. I achieve more in my life
when I am in this form of relationship. I try harder, work
harder, am more creative, think better of myself, excel in most
every aspect of my life."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"...I go ahead and cater to him and
pretend that his words don't hurt, and later, I engage in an
internal fight with myself for being so damned submissive. It's a
constant battle and I can't seem to decide which voice in my head
I should listen to... I feel like a fool, yet, I would rather be
a fool with him than a lonely, well-rounded woman without him.
I've often said that the only way that we can stay together is
because we feed off of each other. I give him everything he needs
and he takes it. Seeing him happy and pleased is what gives me
pleasure. I feel very successful then."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Partial NPD</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I do think it's uncommon for girls to
develop these patterns, as they are usually trained to be
self-effacing. I certainly was! However, I have a lot of the very
same underlying patterns that full-blown, obnoxiously egotistical
NP's have, but I am not egotistical because I didn't develop the
pattern of inflated Ego and grandiosity. All the rest of it is
there, though: fragile Ego, lack of a centre or self,
super-sensitive to criticism and rejections, pathological,
obsessive envy, comparisons and competitive attitudes toward
others, a belief that everyone in the world is either superior or
inferior to me, and so on.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Sometimes I kind of wish I had developed
the inflated Ego of a complete NP, because then I would at least
be able to hide from all the pain I feel. But at the same time,
I'm glad I didn't, because those people have a much lower chance
of recovery &ndash; how can they recover if they don't
acknowledge anything is wrong? Whereas it's pretty clear to me I
have problems, and I've spent my life working on them and trying
to change myself and heal."</span></i></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Narcissist-Non Narcissist</span></h4>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">And Narcissist-Inverted Narcissist
Couples</span></h4>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"Can a N and a non-N ever maintain a
long lasting marriage? It would seem that a non-N would have too
much self-esteem to lend himself to a lifetime of catering and
pandering to an N's unending need for unearned adoration and
glory. I, as a non-N... got tired of these people and their
unremitting attempts to drain my psyche within a relatively short
period of time and abandoned them as soon as I realised what I
was dealing with to preserve my own sanity."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"It depends on the non-narcissist,
really. Narcissism is a RIGID, systemic pattern of responses. It
is so all-pervasive and all-encompassing that it is a PERSONALITY
disorder. If the non-narcissist is codependent, for instance,
then the narcissist is a perfect match for him and the union will
last..."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"You have to pimp for the narcissist,
intellectually, and sexually. If your narcissist is somatic, you
are much better off lining up the sex partners than leaving it to
him. Intellectual pimping is more varied. You can think of
wonderful things and then subtly string out the idea, in the most
delicate of packages and watch the narcissist cogitate their way
to 'their' brilliant discovery whilst you bask in the glow of
their perfection and success... The point of this entire exercise
is to assure YOUR supply, which is the narcissist himself, not to
punish yourself by giving away a great idea or abase yourself
because, of course, YOU are not worthy of having such a great
idea on your own &ndash; but who knows, it may seem that way to
the inverted narcissist. It really depends on how self-aware the
inverted is."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"The only rejection you need to fear is
the possibility of losing the narcissist and if one is doing
everything else right, this is very unlikely to happen! So by
'emotionally independent' I am talking about being self-assured,
doing your own thing, having a life, feeling strong and good
about yourself, getting emotional sustenance from other people. I
mean, let's face it, a drug is a drug is a habit. Habits just
are, and what they ARE NOT are the be all and end all of love,
commitment and serene symmetrical, balanced emotional perfection
that is the ideal of the romanticised 'love-for-a-lifetime'
all-American relationship dream."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"(I am) terribly turned on by
narcissists. The most exciting moments of my life in every venue
have been with narcissists. It is as if living and loving with
normal people is a grey thing by comparison, not fuelled by
sufficient adrenaline. I feel like a junkie, now, that I no
longer permit myself the giddy pleasure of the RUSH I used to
know when I was deeply and hopelessly involved with an N. I am
like a lotus-eater. And I always felt guilty about this and also
sorry that I ever succumbed that first time to my first
narcissist lover."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I am exactly this way and I feel
exactly as you do, that the world is a sepia motion picture but
when I am intimately involved with a narcissist, it breaks out
into three-dimensional Technicolor and I can see and feel in ways
that are not available to me otherwise. In my case I developed
this (inverted narcissism) as a result of being the favourite of
my father who so completely absorbed me into his personality that
I was not able to develop a sense of separation. So I am stuck in
this personality matrix of needing to be engulfed, adored by and
completely taken over by a narcissist in my life. In turn, I
worship, defend, regulate and procure Narcissistic Supply for my
narcissist. It is like the mould and the moulded."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"In my case, I realise that while I
can't stop loving my current narcissist, it isn't necessary for
me to avoid as long as I can understand. In my way of looking at
it, he is deserving of love, and since I can give him love
without it hurting me, then as long as he needs it, he shall have
it."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"My personal theory is that dogmatic
religious culture is a retarding influence on the growth and
maturation of those heavily involved &ndash; more and more
autonomy (and hence personal responsibility) seems to be blithely
sacrificed to the group mind/spirit. It is as though the church
members become one personality and that personality is
narcissistic and the individual just folds under the weight of
that kind of group pressure &ndash; particularly if you are a
child."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"If I displayed behaviour that made my
XXX look good to others, I was insipidly overvalued. When I dared
be something other than who she wanted me to be, the sarcastic
criticism and total devaluation was unbelievable. So, I learned
to be all things to all people. I get a heavenly high from
surrendering my power to a narcissist, to catering to them, in
having them overvalue and need me, and it is the only time that I
truly feel alive..."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"We have very little choice in all of
this. We are as vacant and warped as the narcissist. XXX is wont
to say, 'I don't HAVE a personality disorder, I AM a personality
disorder.' It defines who we are and how we will respond. You
will always and ONLY have real feelings when you are with a
narcissist. It is your love map, it is the programming within
your psyche. Does it need to control your behaviour? Not
necessarily. Knowing what you are can at least give you the
opportunity to forecast the effect of an action before you take
it. So, loveless black and white may be the very healthiest thing
for you for the foreseeable future. I tend to think of these
episodes with narcissists as being cyclic. You will likely need
to cut loose for a while when your child is older.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">DO NOT feel ashamed please! Should a
physically handicapped person feel ashamed of their handicap? No
and neither should we. The trouble with us is that we are fooled
into thinking that these relationships are 'guilty pleasures'.
They feel so very good for a time but they are more akin to
addiction satisfaction rather than being the 'right match' or an
'appropriate relationship'. I am still very conflicted myself
about this. I wrote a few months ago that it was like having a
caged very dangerous animal inside of me. When I get near
narcissists, the animal smells its own kind and it wants out. I
very carefully 'micro-manage' my life. This means that I daily do
fairly regular reality checks and keep a very tight reign on my
self and my behaviours. I am also
obsessive-compulsive."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I feel as though I'm constantly on an
emotional roller coaster. I may wake up in a good mood, but if my
N partner does or says something, which is hurtful to me, my mood
changes immediately. I now feel sad, empty, afraid. All I want to
do at this point is anything that will make him say something
NICE to me.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Once he does, I'm back on top of the
world. This pattern of mood changes, or whatever you may call
them, can take place several times a day. Each and every day.
I've gotten to the point where I'm not sure that I can trust
myself to feel any one way, because I know that I have no control
over myself. He has the control. It's scary, yet I've sort of
come to depend on him determining how I am going to
feel."</span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"When I was first involved with my
cerebral narcissist I was like this but after awhile I just
learned to become more emotionally distant (the ups and downs
were just too much) and find emotional gratification with other
people, mostly girl friends and one of two male friends. I make a
point of saying... that the invert must be or become emotionally
and financially independent (if you don't do this he will eat you
up and when he has finished with you and you are nothing but a
husk, you will be expelled from his life in one big vomit). It is
really important for you to start to take responsibility for your
own emotional wellness without regard to how he treats you.
Remember that the narcissist has the emotional maturity of a
two-year old! Don't expect much in the way of emotional depth or
support in your relationship &ndash; he simply is not capable of
anything that sophisticated."</span></i></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Mental
Health Disorders</span></h1>

<h2><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Co-Morbidity
and Dual Diagnosis</span></h2>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode:line'>Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Does narcissism often occur
with other mental health disorders (co-morbidity) or with
substance abuse (dual diagnosis)?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode:line'>Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) is often
diagnosed with other mental health disorders (such as the
Borderline, Histrionic or Antisocial Personality Disorder). This
is called "co-morbidity". It is also often accompanied by
substance abuse and other reckless and impulsive behaviours and
this is called "dual diagnosis".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">But there is one curious match, one
logic-defying co-appearance of mental health disorders:
narcissism and the Schizoid Personality Disorder [see FAQ
38].</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The basic dynamic of this particular brand
of co-morbidity goes like this:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">1. The narcissist feels superior, unique,
entitled and better than his fellow men. He thus tends to despise
them, to hold them in contempt and to regard them as lowly and
subservient beings.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">2. The narcissist feels that his time is
invaluable, his mission of cosmic importance, his contributions
to humanity priceless. He, therefore, demands total obedience and
catering to his ever-changing needs. Any demands on his time and
resources is deemed to be both humiliating and
wasteful.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">3. But the narcissist is DEPENDENT on input
from other people for the performance of certain Ego functions
(such as the regulation of his sense of self-worth). Without
Narcissistic Supply (adulation, adoration, attention), the
narcissist shrivels and withers and is dysphoric
(=depressed).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">4. The narcissist resents this dependence
(described in point 3). He is furious at himself for his
neediness and &ndash; in a typical narcissistic manoeuvre (called
"alloplastic defence") &ndash; he blames OTHERS for his anger. He
displaces his rage and its roots.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">5. Many narcissists are paranoids. This
means that they are afraid of people and of what people might do
to them. Think about it: wouldn't you be scared and paranoid if
your very life depended continually on the goodwill of others?
The narcissist's very life depends on others providing him with
Narcissistic Supply. He becomes suicidal if they stop doing
so.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">6. To counter this overwhelming feeling of
helplessness (=dependence on Narcissistic Supply), the narcissist
becomes a control freak. He sadistically manipulates others to
satisfy his needs. He derives pleasure from the utter subjugation
of his human environment.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">7. Finally, the narcissist is a latent
masochist. He seeks punishment, castigation and ex-communication.
This self-destruction is the only way to validate powerful voices
he internalised as a child ("You are a bad, rotten, hopeless
child").</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">As you can easily see, the narcissistic
landscape is fraught with contradictions. The narcissist depends
on people &ndash; but hates and despises them. He wants to
control them unconditionally &ndash; but is also looking to
punish himself savagely. He is terrified of persecution
("persecutory delusions") &ndash; but seeks the company of his
own "persecutors" compulsively. The narcissist is the victim of
incompatible inner dynamics, ruled by numerous vicious circles,
pushed and pulled simultaneously by irresistible forces. A
minority of narcissists choose the SCHIZOID SOLUTION. They
choose, in effect, to disengage, both emotionally and socially
[see FAQ 38].</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>HPD
(Histrionic Personality Disorder) and Somatic NPD</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>I "invented"
another &ndash; twilight zone &ndash; category between NPD and
HPD, which I call "somatic narcissists". These are narcissists
who acquire their Narcissistic Supply by making use of their
bodies, of sex, of physical of physiological achievements,
traits, health, exercise, or relationships.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Here is how
the DSM-IV defines HPD:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>A pervasive
pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking,
beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
contexts, as indicated by five or more of the
following:</span></p>

<p>&bull; Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is
not the centre of attention;</p>

<p>&bull; Interaction with others is often characterised by
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUALLY SEDUCTIVE or provocative behaviour (very
rare with a narcissist &ndash; SV);</p>

<p>&bull; Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of
emotions;</p>

<p>&bull; Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention
to self;</p>

<p>&bull; Has a style of speech that is excessively
impressionistic and lacking in detail;</p>

<p>&bull; Shows self-dramatisation, theatricality, and
exaggerated expression of emotion;</p>

<p>&bull; Is suggestible, i.e. easily influenced by others or
circumstances;</p>

<p>&bull; Considers relationships to be more intimate than they
actually are.</p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Narcissists
and Depression</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>If by
"depression" we also mean "numbness" then narcissists are often
depressed. Most narcissists are simply numb, emotionally absent,
non-existent. Their emotions are not accessible, not "available"
to them. So, they inhabit a grey emotional twilight zone. The
world looks false, fake, invented, contrived, in wrong hues. But
they do not have a sense of living in prison. Once in prison, the
inmate remembers there's an outside world and a way out. Not so
in narcissism. The outside has long faded into oblivion. And
there's no way out.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>DID and
NPD</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Is the False
Self an alter? In other words: is the True Self of a narcissist
the equivalent of a host personality in a DID (Dissociative
Identity Disorder) &ndash; and the False Self</span> <span lang=
"EN-GB">&ndash; <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>one of the
fragmented personalities, also known as
"alters"?</span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>My personal
opinion is that the False Self is a construct, not a self in the
full sense. It is the locus of the fantasies of grandiosity, the
feelings of entitlements, omnipotence, magical thinking,
omniscience and magical immunity of the narcissist. It lacks so
many other elements that it can hardly be called a "self".
Moreover, it has no "cut-off" date. DID alters have a date of
inception, as a reaction to trauma or abuse (they have an "age").
The False Self is a process, not an entity, it is a reactive
pattern and a reactive formation. All taken into account, the
choice of words by various theoreticians was poor. The False Self
is not a self, nor is it false. It is very real, more real to the
narcissist than his True Self. A better choice would have been
"abuse reactive self" or something to that effect.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>I say that
narcissists vanish and are replaced by a False Self [Kernberg].
There is NO True Self in there. It's gone. The narcissist is a
hall of mirrors &ndash; but the hall itself is an optical
illusion created by the mirrors... This is a little like the
paintings of Escher.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>MPD (DID) is
more common than believed. Those are the emotions that are
segregated. The notion of "unique separate multiple whole
personalities" is primitive and untrue. DID is a continuum. The
inner language breaks down into polyglottal chaos. Emotions
cannot communicate with each other for fear of pain (and its
fatal results). So, they are being kept apart by various
mechanisms (a host or birth personality, a facilitator, a
moderator and so on).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>All PDs
&ndash; except NPD &ndash; suffer from a modicum of dissociation.
The narcissistic solution is to emotionally disappear. Hence, the
tremendous, insatiable need of the narcissist for external
approval. He exists ONLY as a reflection. Since he is forbidden
to love his self &ndash; he chooses to have no self at all. It is
not dissociation &ndash; it is a vanishing act.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>This is why
I regard pathological narcissism as THE Source of all PDs. The
total, "pure" solution is NPD: self-extinguishing,
self-abolishing, totally fake. Then come variations on the
self-hate and perpetuated self-abuse themes: HPD (NPD with
sex/body as the Source of the Narcissistic Supply), BPD
(lability, movement between poles of life wish and death wish)
and so on.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Why are
narcissists not prone to suicide? Simple: they died a long time
ago. They are the true zombies of the world. Read vampire and
zombie legends and you will see how narcissistic these creatures
are.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>NPD and
ADHD</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>NPD has been
associated lately with Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD or ADD) and with RAD (attachment disorder). The rationale
is that children suffering from ADHD are unlikely to develop the
attachment necessary to prevent a narcissistic regression [Freud]
or adaptation [Jung]. Bonding and object relations ought to be
affected by ADHD. Research, which supports this has yet to be
made available. Still, many psychotherapists and psychiatrists
use it as a working hypothesis. Another proposed linkage is
between autistic disorders (such as Asperger's Syndrome) and
narcissism.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>BPD, NPD and
other Cluster B PDs</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>All PDs are
interrelated, in my view, at least phenomenologically. True,
there is no "grand unifying theory of psychopathology". No one
knows whether there are &ndash; and what are &ndash; the
mechanisms underlying mental disorders. At best, mental health
professionals register symptoms (as reported by the patient) and
signs (as observed). Then, they group them into syndromes and,
more specifically, into disorders. This is descriptive, not
explanatory science. Sure, there are a few theories around
(psychoanalysis, to mention the most famous) but they all failed
miserably at providing a coherent, consistent theoretical
framework with predictive powers and falsifiable
predictions.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Still,
observations are a powerful tool, if properly used. People who
suffer from personality disorders have many things in
common:</span></p>

<p>&bull; Most of them are insistent (except those suffering from
the Schizoid or the Avoidant Personality Disorders). They demand
treatment on a preferential and privileged basis. They complain
about numerous symptoms. They never obey the physician or his
treatment recommendations and instructions.</p>

<p>&bull; They regard themselves as unique, display a streak of
grandiosity and a diminished capacity for empathy (the ability to
appreciate and respect the needs and wishes of other people).
They regard the physician as inferior to them, alienate him using
umpteen techniques and bore him with their never-ending
self-preoccupation.</p>

<p>&bull; They are manipulative and exploitative because they
trust no one and usually cannot love or share. They are socially
maladaptive and emotionally unstable.</p>

<p>&bull; Most personality disorders start out as problems in
personal development which peak during adolescence and then
become personality disorders. They stay on as enduring qualities
of the individual. Personality disorders are stable and
all-pervasive &ndash; not episodic. They affect most of the areas
of functioning of the patient: his career, his interpersonal
relationships, his social functioning.</p>

<p>&bull; The person suffering a PD is not happy. He is
depressed, suffers from auxiliary mood, affective and anxiety
disorders. He does not like himself, his character, his
(deficient) functioning, or his (crippling) influence on others.
But his defences are so strong, that he is, usually, dimly aware
only of the distress &ndash; and not of its reasons to it.</p>

<p>&bull; The patient with a personality disorder is vulnerable
to and prone to suffer from a host of other psychiatric
disturbances. It is as though his psychological immunological
system has been disabled by the personality disorder and he falls
prey to other variants of mental sickness. So much energy is
consumed by the disorder and by its corollaries (example: by
obsessions-compulsions), that the patient is rendered
defenceless.</p>

<p>&bull; Patients with personality disorders are alloplastic in
their defences. In other words: they would tend to blame the
external world for their mishaps. In stressful situations, they
try to pre-empt a (real or imaginary) threat, change the rules of
the game, introduce new variables, or otherwise influence the
external world to conform to their needs. This is as opposed to
autoplastic defences exhibited, for instance, by neurotics (who
change their internal psychological processes in stressful
situations).</p>

<p>&bull; The character problems, behavioural deficits and
emotional deficiencies and instability encountered by the patient
with a personality disorder are, mostly, ego-syntonic. This means
that the patient does not find his personality traits or
behaviour objectionable, unacceptable, disagreeable, or alien to
his self. As opposed to that, neurotics are ego-dystonic: they do
not like what they are and how they behave.</p>

<p>&bull; The personality-disordered are not psychotic. They have
no hallucinations, delusions or thought disorders (except those
who suffer from the Borderline Personality Disorder and who
experience brief psychotic "microepisodes", mostly during
treatment).</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>They are
also fully oriented, with clear senses (sensorium), good memory
and general fund of knowledge and are, in all-important respects,
"normal".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>I think that
each PD has its own form of Narcissistic Supply:</span></p>

<p>&bull; <i>HPD</i> (Histrionic PD) &ndash; Sex, seduction,
flirtation, romance, body;</p>

<p>&bull; <i>NPD</i> (Narcissistic PD) &ndash; Adulation,
admiration;</p>

<p>&bull; <i>BPD</i> (Borderline PD) &ndash; Presence (they are
terrified of abandonment);</p>

<p>&bull; <i>AsPD</i> (Antisocial PD) &ndash; Money, power,
control, fun.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>To my mind,
BPDs, for instance, are NPDs who are scared of being abandoned.
They know that if they hurt people, the latter might abandon
them. So, they are very careful. They DO care deeply about not
hurting others &ndash; but this is a selfish motivation: they
don't want to lose those others, they are dependent on them. If
you are a drug addict, you are not likely to pick up a fight with
your pusher. BPDs also have deficient impulse control, as do
AsPDs.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Each PD has
its own "story", a "narrative". The way to healing is replete
with the ostracons of these narratives. To heal, a PD MUST break
through his or her narrative and OUT into the world and to assume
personal responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>All PDs
engage in scapegoating and bag-punching. Their parents, abusers,
the world, God, or history are responsible for what they are and
what we do DECADES after the original abuse. Research shows that
the brain is more plastic than many thought it to be. One can
CHOOSE to heal. If one doesn't &ndash; it is because there is
gain in infirmity.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>NPDs and
Other PDs</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>A few points
to ponder:</span></p>

<p>&bull; NPDs are afraid of abandonment and do everything they
can to bring it about (and thus "control" it). BPDs are terrified
of abandonment and they do everything they can either to avoid
relationships in the first place &ndash; or to prevent
abandonment (cling or emotionally extort) once in a
relationship.</p>

<p>&bull; Seductive behaviour alone is NOT necessarily indicative
of HPD. Somatic narcissists behave this way as well.</p>

<p>&bull; I think that the diagnostic distinctions between the
Cluster B disorders are pretty artificial. It is true that some
traits are much more pronounced (or even qualitatively different)
in given disorders. For example: the grandiose fantasies typical
to a narcissist (their pervasiveness, their influence on the
minutest behaviour, their tendency to inflate and so on) &ndash;
are rather unique in both severity and character to NPD.</p>

<p>&bull; But I think that they all the Cluster B Personality
Disorders occupy a continuum.</p>

<p>&bull; It used to be thought that NPDs are ego-syntonic ALL
the time. That they do not have reactive psychoses and do not
suffer from psychotic microepisodes under stress. Recent research
has disproved these "differential diagnoses criteria". NPDs are a
lot like BPDs in so many respects that the likes of Kernberg
suggested abolishing the distinction altogether. All Cluster B
PDs seem to arise from pathological narcissism.</p>

<p>&bull; NPD rarely comes in its "pure" form. It is almost
always co-morbid with other disorders (OCD, BPD, HPD, AsPD).</p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>NPD and
Neuroses</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The
differences between PDs and neuroses is that PDs have ALLOPLASTIC
defences (react to stress by attempting to change the external
environment or by shifting the blame to it) while neurotics have
AUTOPLASTIC defences (react to stress by attempting to change
their internal processes, or assuming blame). The second
important difference is that PDs TEND to be ego-syntonic
(perceived by the patient to be acceptable, unobjectionable and
part of the self) while neurotics tend to be ego-dystonic (the
opposite).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>This is
exactly why PD Clusters were invented in 1987. I, personally, as
I said, feel that there is a continuum
BPD-HPD-NPD-AsPD.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>A sense of
entitlement, for instance, is common to ALL Cluster B disorders.
Narcissists almost never act on their suicidal ideation &ndash;
BPDs do so incessantly (cutting &ndash; self injury &ndash; or
mutilation). But both tend to become suicidal in
crisis.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>NPDs can
suffer from brief reactive psychoses exactly as BPDs suffer from
psychotic microepisodes. Actually, there is a whole sub-field in
psychodynamic theories of narcissism, which tries to explain the
dynamics of reactive psychoses in pathological
narcissism.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>There are
some differences between NPD and BPD, though:</span></p>

<p>a. The narcissist is much less impulsive;</p>

<p>b. The narcissist is less self-destructive, rarely
self-mutilates, and practically never attempts suicide;</p>

<p>c. The narcissist is more stable (reduced emotional lability,
stability in interpersonal relationships and so on).</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Psychopaths
or sociopaths are the old names for Antisocial PD. They are no
longer in use, generally. But, the line between NPD and AsPD is
very thin. I, personally, believe (especially after my work in
prison) that AsPD is simply a less inhibited form of NPD and that
applying the two diagnoses to the same person is
superfluous.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
differential diagnoses are nowhere near where they should be
ideally but are developing by the day. At this stage,
diagnosticians are in the habit of diagnosing multiple PDs
("co-morbidity"). It is extremely rare to diagnose a single pure
PD. Some textbooks at home which URGE diagnosticians NEVER to
render in single diagnosis.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The
Hated-Hating Personality Disordered</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Personality
disordered people are usually hated. One needs only to read
professional texts to see how despised, derided, hated and
avoided the personality disordered are even by the therapeutic
professions. Because many people don't even realise that they
suffer from a personality disorder &ndash; they feel victimised,
wronged, discriminated against and hopeless. They don't
understand why they are so hated, avoided and abandoned. They
define themselves as victims and attribute mental disorders to
others ("pathologising").</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>They employ
the primitive defence mechanisms of splitting and projection
augmented by the more sophisticated mechanism of projective
identification.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>In other
words:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>They
"split-off" from their personality the bad feelings of hating and
being hated &ndash; because they cannot cope with negative
feelings.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Then, they
project these feelings unto others ("He hates me, I don't hate
anyone", "I am a good soul, but he is a psychopath", "He is
stalking me, I just want to stay away from him", "He is a
con-artist, I am the innocent victim").</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Then they
FORCE others to behave in a way that JUSTIFIES their projections
and models (projective identification followed by counter
projective identification).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Some
narcissists, for instance, firmly "believe" that women are evil
predators, out to suck their lifeblood and then abandon them. So,
they try and make them fulfil the prophecy. They try and make
sure that women behave exactly in this manner, that they do not
abnegate and ruin the model that the narcissist so craftily, so
elaborately and so studiously designed.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Such
narcissists tease women and betray them and bad mouth them and
taunt them and torment them and stalk them and haunt them and
pursue them and subjugate them and frustrate them until they do
abandon them.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>At this
stage the narcissist feels vindicated &ndash; not realising HIS
contribution to this recurrent pattern.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
personality disordered are full of negative emotions. They are
filled to the brim with aggression and its transmutations, hatred
and pathological envy. They are constantly seething with rage,
repressed anger, jealousy and other corroding emotions. Unable to
release these emotions (personality disorders are defence
mechanisms against "forbidden" emotions) &ndash; they split them,
project them and force others to behave in a way which
LEGITIMISES and EXPLAINS these negative emotions. "No wonder I
hate him so &ndash; look what he did to me." The personality
disordered are doomed to inhabit the land of self-inflicted
injuries. They generate the very hate that legitimises their
hate, which generated the hate in the first place.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The
Borderline Narcissist &ndash; A Psychotic?</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Kernberg came
up with the borderline diagnosis. It is somewhere between
psychotic and neurotic (actually between psychotic and the
personality disordered). The differentiation is this:</span></p>

<p>&bull; Neurotic &ndash; autoplastic defences (something's
wrong with me).</p>

<p>&bull; Personality disordered &ndash; alloplastic defences
(something's wrong with the world).</p>

<p>&bull; Psychotics &ndash; something's wrong with those who say
that something's wrong with me.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>ALL
personality disorders have a clear psychotic streak. Borderlines
have psychotic episodes. Narcissists react with psychosis to life
crises and in treatment ("psychotic microepisodes" which can
last...days!!!).</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Narcissism
&ndash; The Root of All Evil</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Pathological
narcissism is considered by some to be the phenomenon underlying
most mental disorders. I describe how pathological narcissism
develops into various personality disorders in FAQs 41 and 42.
All personality disorders are either variations on a theme or
appear intermingled. Thus, a SINGLE mental health category with
different axes and intensities would have been a more appropriate
("process-orientated") approach, to my mind.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>I think that
all Cluster B Personality Disorders (being more mean than
arrogant, for instance, is called Antisocial Personality Disorder
and being more haughty than mean is called Narcissistic
Personality Disorder) are arbitrary points in a
continuum.</span></p>

and even abuse. For example, one masochistic patient's
narcissistic father told him as a child that if he said 'one more
word' that he would hit him with a belt and the patient defiantly
responded to his father by saying 'One more word!' Thus, what may
appear, at times, to be masochistic or self-defeating behaviour
may also be viewed as self-affirming behaviour on the part of the
child toward the narcissistic parent."</span></i></p>

deviation or perversion). It has been closely associated with
incest (research supports this) and paedophilia (which research

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>A
personality disorder is a COMPLEX of hundreds of separate
behaviours. Surely, each behaviour pattern taken separately can
have a different label. Moreover, the same behaviour pattern can
(and often does) occur in a few mental health disorders. For
instance, "hysteroid dysphoria" (I am not a fan of this
"definition") is also a part of the cyclothimic disorder. But, in
the CONTEXT of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder what I
describe in FAQ 10 is one of a group of recurrent dysphorias
identified as early as 1960.</span></p>

Narcissistic PD has finally crystallised as a mental health

interventions (response rates to MAOIs, for example, are
comparable to those of melancholic depressives). I'm sure that a
lot of them do have chaotic childhoods, but then again, a lot of
people with chaotic childhoods DON'T grow up to become hysteroid
dysphorics, so there has to be more to it than just that, even if
it does play some role. The use of the word "hysteroid"

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The Inverted
Narcissist &ndash; A Masochist?</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The "inverted
narcissist" (IN) is described in great detail in FAQ
37.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The IN is
much closer to being a co-dependent than a masochist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Masochism is
a whole different ballgame. Strictly speaking it is only of a
sexual nature (as in sado-masochism). But the colloquial term
means "seeking gratification through pain".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>This is not
the case with co-dependents or IN. The latter is a specific
variant of codependent that derives gratification from a
relationship with a narcissist or an Antisocial Personality
Disordered partner. But the gratification has nothing to do with
the (very real) emotional (and, at times, physical) pain
inflicted upon the IN.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Rather, in
the case of the IN, the gratification has to do with shadows of
the past re-awakened. In the narcissist, the IN feels that he
found a lost parent. The IN seeks to re-enact old unresolved
conflicts through the agency of the narcissist. There is a latent
hope that this time, the IN will get it "right", that THIS
emotional liaison or interaction will not end in bitter
disappointment and lasting agony.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Yet, by
choosing a narcissist, the IN ensures an identical outcome of his
relationships time and again. Why should one elect to FAIL in his
or her relationships, is an intriguing question. Partly, it is
the comfort of familiarity. The IN is used &ndash; since
childhood &ndash; to failing relationships. It seems that the IN
prefers predictability to emotional gratification and to personal
development. There are also strong elements of self-punishment
and self-destruction added to the combustible mix that is the
dyad narcissist-inverted narcissist.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>NPD,
AsPD</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The important
differences between narcissism and the Antisocial Personality
Disorder (AsPD or psychopaths, in the old terminology)
are:</span></p>

<p>&bull; Inability or unwillingness to control impulses
(AsPD);</p>

<p>&bull; Enhanced lack of empathy on the part of the AsPD;</p>

<p>&bull; Inability to form relationships with other humans, not
even the narcissistically twisted types of relationships;</p>

<p>&bull; Total disregard for society, its conventions, social
cues and social treaties.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>As opposed
to what Scott Peck says, narcissists are not evil &ndash; they
lack the intention to cause harm.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>They are
simply indifferent, callous and careless in their conduct and in
their treatment of their fellow humans.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">Eating Disorders and the
Narcissist</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Do narcissists also suffer from eating disorders such as
bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Patients suffering from eating disorders binge on food
and sometimes are both anorectic and bulimic. This is an
impulsive behaviour as defined by the DSM (particularly in the
case of BPD and to a lesser extent of Cluster B disorders in
general). Some patients adopt these disorders as a way to
self-mutilate. It is a convergence of two pathological
behaviours: self-mutilation and an impulsive (rather, compulsive
or ritualistic) behaviour.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The key to improving the mental state of
patients with dual diagnosis (a personality disorder plus an
eating disorder) lies in concentrating upon their eating and
sleeping disorders. In my view, these disorders are a blessing in
disguise.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">By controlling their eating disorders,
patients assert control over their lives. This is bound to reduce
their depression (even eliminate it altogether as a constant
feature of their mental life). This is likely to ameliorate other
facets of their personality disorders. Here is the chain:
controlling one's eating disorders</span> <span>&agrave;</span>
<span lang="EN-GB">controlling one's life</span>
<span>&agrave;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">a sense of self-worth,
self-confidence, self-esteem</span> <span>&agrave;</span> <span
lang="EN-GB">a challenge, an interest, an enemy to
subjugate</span> <span>&agrave;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">a
feeling of strength</span> <span>&agrave;</span> <span lang=
"EN-GB">socialising</span> <span>&agrave;</span> <span lang=
"EN-GB">feeling better.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">When a patient has a personality disorder
and an eating disorder, the therapist should concentrate on the
eating disorder. Personality disorders are intricate and
intractable. They are rarely curable (though certain aspects,
like OCD, or depression can be ameliorated with medication).
Their treatment calls for the enormous, persistent and continuous
investment of resources of every kind by everyone involved. From
the patient's point of view, the treatment of her personality
disorder is not an efficient allocation of scarce mental
resources. Also personality disorders are not the real threat. If
a patient with a personality disorder is cured of it but her
eating disorders are aggravated, she might die (though mentally
healthy)...</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">An eating disorder is both a signal of
distress ("I wish to die, I feel so bad, somebody help me") and a
message: "I think I lost control. I am very afraid of losing
control. I will control my food intake and discharge. This way I
control at least ONE aspect of my life."</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This is where we can and should begin to
help the patient. Help him to regain control. The family or other
supporting figures must think what they can do to make the
patient feel that he is in control, that he manages things his
own way, that he is contributing, has his own schedules, his own
agenda, possesses both authority and responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Eating disorders indicate the strong
combined activity of an underlying sense of lack of personal
autonomy and an underlying sense of lack of self-control. The
patient feels inordinately, paralysingly helpless and
ineffective. His eating disorders are an effort to exert and
reassert mastery over his own life. At this stage, he is unable
to differentiate his own feelings and needs from those of others.
His cognitive and perceptual distortions (for instance, regarding
body image &ndash; somatoform disorders) only increase his
feeling of personal ineffectiveness and his need to exercise even
more self-control (of his diet, the only thing left).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The patient does not trust himself AT ALL,
not in the slightest. He is his worst enemy, a mortal enemy, and
he knows it. Therefore, any efforts to collaborate with HIM
against his disorder &ndash; are perceived by him as
collaboration with his worst enemy against his only mode of
controlling his life to some extent.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The patient views the world in terms of
black and white, of absolutes. So, he cannot let go even to a
very small degree. He is HORRIFIED &ndash; constantly. This is
why he finds it impossible to form relationships: he mistrusts
(himself and by extension others), he does not want to become an
adult, he does not enjoy sex or love (which both entail a modicum
of a loss of control). All this leads to a chronic absence of
self-esteem. These patients like their disorder. Their eating
disorder is their only achievement in life. Otherwise they are
ashamed of themselves and disgusted by their shortcomings
(expressed through shame and disgust directed at their
bodies).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">There is a chance to cure the patient of
his eating disorders (though the dual diagnosis of eating
disorder and personality disorder has a poor prognosis). This
&ndash; and ONLY this &ndash; must be done at the first stage.
The patient's family or closest should consider therapy AND
support groups (the equivalent of Alcoholics Anonymous or a 12
step program for eating disorders). Recovery prognosis is good
after 2 years of treatment and support. The family must be
heavily involved in the therapeutic process. Family dynamics
usually contribute to the development of such
disorders.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Medication + cognitive or behavioural
therapy + psychodynamic therapy + family therapy ought to do
it.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The change in the patient IF the treatment
of his eating disorders is successful is VERY MARKED. His major
depression disappears together with his sleeping disorders. He
becomes socially active again and gets a life. His personality
disorder might make it difficult for him &ndash; but, in
isolation, without the exacerbating circumstances of his other
disorders, he finds it much easier to cope with.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Patients with eating disorders may be in
mortal danger. Their behaviour is ruining their bodies
relentlessly and inexorably. They might attempt suicide. They
might do drugs. It is only a question of time. Our goal is to buy
them time. The older they get, the more experienced they become,
the more their body chemistry changes with age &ndash; the better
their prognosis.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">How to Recognise a Narcissist?</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">How to recognise a narcissist before it is "too
late"?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Many of my correspondents complain of the incredible
deceptive powers of the narcissist. They found themselves
involved with narcissists (emotionally, in business, or
otherwise) before they had a chance to discover his true
character. Shocked by the later discovery, they mourn their
inabilities: their current inability to separate from him and
their past inability to see through him. Narcissists are
perceived as such only post facto and when it is too
late.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">There is no need to rehash the classic
symptoms of the narcissistic personality.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">These are enumerated in the DSM-IV and are
studied at length in this book. We are evidently looking for the
more subtle, almost subliminal, signals that a narcissist emits.
The psychotherapist would be looking for the "presenting
symptoms".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">One should look for the
following:</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">"Haughty" body language</span></i> <span
lang="EN-GB">&ndash; A physical posture implying and exuding an
air of superiority, seniority, hidden powers, mysteriousness,
amused indifference, etc. Rarely does the narcissist engage in
eye contact and normally he refrains from bodily contact,
physical proximity, or from engaging in a discussion unless from
a state of condescension, faked "magnanimity and largesse". He
rarely mingles socially and prefers to adopt the stance of the
"observer" or the "lone wolf".</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Entitlement markers</span></i> <span
lang="EN-GB">&ndash; The narcissist immediately asks for "special
treatment" of some kind. Not to wait his turn, to have a longer
or a shorter therapeutic session, to talk directly to authority
figures (and not to their assistants or secretaries), to have
special payment terms, custom tailored arrangements, special
attention by the head waiter in a restaurant and so on. He reacts
with rage and indignantly if denied his wishes.</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Idealisation or devaluation</span></i>
<span lang="EN-GB">&ndash; The narcissist instantly idealises or
devalues, depending on his appraisal of the potential one has as
a Narcissistic Supply Source. He IMMEDIATELY flatters, adores,
admires and applauds the "target" in an embarrassingly
exaggerated and profuse manner &ndash; or sulk, abuse and
humiliate. In the second case (devaluation) he may force himself
to be polite (because of the presence of a potential Supply
Source). But this is bound to be a barbed sort of politeness,
which rapidly deteriorates and degenerates into verbal or other
violent displays of abuse, rage attacks, or cold detachment,
totally out of the control of the narcissist.</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">The "membership" posture</span></i>
<span lang="EN-GB">&ndash; The narcissist always tries to
"belong". Yet, at the very same time, he maintains his stance as
an outsider. The narcissist seeks to be admired for his ability
to integrate and ingratiate himself without the efforts
commensurate with such an undertaking. For instance: if he talks
to a psychologist, the narcissist makes clear that he never
studied psychology and then proceed to use the most obscure
professional jargon, in an effort to prove that he mastered the
discipline (i.e., that he is exceptionally intelligent or
introspective). In general, the narcissist always prefers
show-off to substance. One of the most effective methods of
exposing a narcissist is by trying to go deeper and discuss
substantial matters. The narcissist is shallow, a pond pretending
to be an ocean. He likes to think of himself as a Renaissance
man, a Jack of all knowledge. A narcissist will never admit to
ignorance IN ANY FIELD!</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Bragging and false
autobiography</span></i><b><span lang="EN-GB">&ndash;</span></b>
<span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist brags. His speech is peppered
with "I", "my", "myself", "mine" and other appropriating
linguistic structures. He describes himself as intelligent, or
rich, or modest, or intuitive, or creative &ndash; but always
excessively and extraordinarily so. One is almost tempted to say,
inhumanly so. His biography sounds implausibly rich and complex.
His achievements &ndash; incommensurate with his age, education,
or recognition. His actual state always appears evidently and
demonstrably incompatible with his claims. Very often, the
narcissist lies or fantasises in a manner very easy to discern.
He always name-drops.</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Emotion-free language</span></i> <span
lang="EN-GB">&ndash; The narcissist likes to talk about himself
and only about himself. He is disinterested in what others have
to tell him about themselves. He might pretend to be interested
&ndash; but this is only with a potential Source of Supply and in
order to obtain said supply. He acts bored, disdainful, even
angry, if he feels intrusion and abuse of his precious time. In
general, the narcissist is a very impatient person, easily bored,
with strong attention deficits &ndash; unless and until he is the
topic of discussion. One can discuss all the aspects of the
intimate life of a narcissist, providing the discourse is not
"emotionally tinted". If asked to relate directly to his
emotions, he will, probably, intellectualise, rationalise, speak
about himself in the third body and in a detached "scientific"
tone or write a short story with a fictitious character in it,
suspiciously autobiographical.</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-GB">Seriousness and sense of intrusion and
coercion</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">&ndash; The narcissist is
dead serious about himself. He may possess a fabulous sense of
humour, scathing and cynical. But he never appreciates it when
this weapon is directed at him. The narcissist regards himself as
being on a constant mission, whose importance is cosmic and whose
consequences are global. If a scientist &ndash; he is always in
the throes of revolutionising science. If a journalist &ndash; he
is in the middle of the greatest story ever. This
self-misperception is not amenable to light-headedness or
self-deprecation. The narcissist is easily hurt and insulted
(narcissist hurt or narcissistic injury). Even the most innocuous
remarks or acts are interpreted by him as belittling, intruding,
or coercive. His time is more valuable than others' &ndash;
therefore, it cannot be wasted on unimportant matters such as
social intercourse. Any suggestion to help, any advice or
concerned inquiry are immediately interpreted as coercion. Any
attempt to set an agenda &ndash; as an intimidating act of
enslavement. In this sense, the narcissist is both schizoid and
paranoid.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">These &ndash; the lack of empathy, the
aloofness, the disdain and sense of entitlement, the restricted
application of his sense of humour, the unequal treatment and
paranoia &ndash; make the narcissist a social misfit. The
narcissist is able to provoke in his social milieu, in his casual
acquaintances, even in his psychotherapist, the strongest, most
avid and furious hatred and revulsion. He provokes violence,
often not knowing why. He is perceived to be asocial at best
(often &ndash; antisocial). This, perhaps, is the strongest
presenting symptom. One feels ill at ease in the presence of a
narcissist &ndash; and rarely knows why. No matter how charming,
intelligent, thought provoking, outgoing, easy going and social
the narcissist is &ndash; he forever fails to secure the sympathy
of his fellow humans, a sympathy he is never ready, willing, or
able to grant them in the first place.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The
Narcissist in a Workplace</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode:line'>Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The narcissist turns the
workplace into a duplicitous hell. What to do?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode:line'>Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB"
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>To a narcissist-employer, the
members of his "staff" are Secondary Sources of Narcissistic
Supply. Their role is to accumulate the supply (in human speak,
remember events that support the grandiose self-image of the
narcissist) and to regulate the Narcissistic Supply of the
narcissist during dry spells (simply put, to adulate, adore,
admire, agree, provide attention and approval and so on or, in
other words, be an audience). The staff (or should we say
"stuff"?) is supposed to remain passive. The narcissist is not
interested in anything but the simplest function of mirroring.
When the mirror acquires a personality and a life of its own, the
narcissist is incensed. When independent minded, an employee
might be in danger of being sacked by his employer (an act which
demonstrates the employer's omnipotence).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
employee's presumption to be the employer's equal (friendship is
possible only among equals) injures the latter narcissistically.
The employer is willing to accept his employees as underlings,
whose very position serves to support his grandiose fantasies.
But the grandiosity rests on such fragile foundations, that any
hint of equality, disagreement or need (that the narcissist
"needs" friends, for instance) threatens the narcissist
profoundly. The narcissist is exceedingly insecure. It is easy to
destabilise his impromptu "personality". His reactions are merely
in self-defence.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Classic
narcissistic behaviour is when idealisation is followed by
devaluation. The devaluing attitude develops as a result of
disagreements OR simply because time has eroded the employee's
capacity to serve as a FRESH Source of Supply.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
employee, taken for granted by the narcissistic employer, becomes
uninspiring as a source of adulation, admiration and attention.
The narcissist always seeks new thrills and stimuli.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist is notorious for his low threshold of resistance to
boredom. His behaviour is impulsive and his biography tumultuous
precisely because of his need to introduce uncertainty and risk
to what he regards as "stagnation" or "slow death" (i.e.,
routine). Most interactions in the workplace are part of the rut
&ndash; and thus constitute a reminder of this routine &ndash;
deflating the narcissist's grandiose fantasies.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Narcissists
do many unnecessary, wrong and even dangerous things in pursuit
of the stabilisation of their inflated self-image.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Narcissists
feel suffocated by intimacy, or by the constant reminders of the
REAL, nitty-gritty world. It reduces them, makes them realise the
Grandiosity Gap (between their self-image and reality). It is a
threat to the precarious balance of their personality structures
(mostly "false", that is, invented) and treated as
such.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Narcissists
forever shift the blame, pass the buck, and engage in cognitive
dissonance. They "pathologise" the other, foster feelings of
guilt and shame in her, demean, debase and humiliate in order to
preserve their sense of grandiosity.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Narcissists
are pathological liars. They think nothing of it because their
very self is FALSE, an invention.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Here are a
few useful guidelines:</span></p>

<p>&bull; Never disagree with the narcissist or contradict
him;</p>

<p>&bull; Never offer him any intimacy;</p>

<p>&bull; Look awed by whatever attribute matters to him (for
instance: by his professional achievements or by his good looks,
or by his success with women and so on);</p>

<p>&bull; Never remind him of life out there and if you do,
connect it somehow to his sense of grandiosity ("These are the
BEST art materials ANY workplace is going to have", "We get them
EXCLUSIVELY", etc.);</p>

<p>&bull; Do not make any comment, which might directly or
indirectly impinge on his self-image, omnipotence, judgement,
omniscience, skills, capabilities, professional record, or even
omnipresence. Bad sentences start with: "I think you overlooked
... made a mistake here ... you don't know ... do you know ...
you were not here yesterday so ... you cannot ... you should ...
(perceived as rude imposition, narcissists react very badly to
restrictions placed on their freedom) ... I (never mention the
fact that you are a separate, independent entity, narcissists
regard others as extensions of their selves, their
internalisation processes were derailed and they did not
differentiate properly)..." You get the gist of it.</p>

style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Narcissists are often vindictive
and they often stalk and harass.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Basically,
there are only two ways of coping with vindictive
narcissists:</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">I. <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>To
Frighten Them</span></span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Narcissists
live in a state of constant rage, repressed aggression, envy and
hatred. They firmly believe that everyone is like them. As a
result, they are paranoid, suspicious, scared and erratic.
Frightening the narcissist is a powerful behaviour modification
tool. If sufficiently deterred &ndash; the narcissist promptly
disengages, gives up everything he was fighting for and sometimes
make amends.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>To act
effectively, one has to identify the vulnerabilities and
susceptibilities of the narcissist and strike repeated,
escalating blows at them &ndash; until the narcissist lets go and
vanishes.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode: line'>Example:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>If a
narcissist is hiding a personal fact &ndash; one should use this
to threaten him. One should drop cryptic hints that there are
mysterious witnesses to the events and recently revealed
evidence. The narcissist has a very vivid imagination. Let his
imagination do the rest.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist may have been involved in tax evasion, in malpractice,
in child abuse, in infidelity &ndash; there are so many
possibilities, which offer a rich vein of attack. If done
cleverly, non-committally, gradually, in an escalating manner
&ndash; the narcissist crumbles, disengages and disappears. He
lowers his profile thoroughly in the hope of avoiding hurt and
pain. Most narcissists have been known to disown and abandon a
whole PNS (Pathological Narcissistic Space) in response to a
well-focused campaign by their victims. Thus, a narcissist may
leave town, change a job, desert a field of professional
interest, avoid friends and acquaintances &ndash; only to secure
a cessation of the unrelenting pressure exerted on him by his
victims.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>I repeat:
most of the drama takes place in the paranoid mind of the
narcissist. His imagination runs amok. He finds himself snarled
by horrifying scenarios, pursued by the vilest "certainties". The
narcissist is his own worst persecutor and prosecutor.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>You don't
have to do much except utter a vague reference, make an ominous
allusion, delineate a possible turn of events. The narcissist
will do the rest for you. He is like a little child in the dark,
generating the very monsters that paralyse him with
fear.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Needless to
add that all these activities have to be pursued legally,
preferably through the good services of law offices and in broad
daylight. If done in the wrong way &ndash; they might constitute
extortion or blackmail, harassment and a host of other criminal
offences.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">II. <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>To
Lure Them</span></span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The other way
to neutralise a vindictive narcissist is to offer him continued
Narcissistic Supply until the war is over and won by you. Dazzled
by the drug of Narcissistic Supply &ndash; the narcissist
immediately becomes tamed, forgets his vindictiveness and
triumphantly takes over his "property" and "territory". Under the
influence of Narcissistic Supply, the narcissist is unable to
tell when he is being manipulated. He is blind, dumb and deaf to
all but the song of the NS sirens. You can make a narcissist do
ANYTHING by offering, withholding, or threatening to withhold
Narcissistic Supply (adulation, admiration, attention, sex, awe,
subservience, etc.).</span></p>

style='font-size:8.0pt'>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION # 69</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">How to Cope with a Narcissist?</span></h1>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">No one bears any responsibility whatsoever
for the narcissist's predicament. To him, others hardly exist
&ndash; so enmeshed he is in himself and in the resulting misery
of this very self-preoccupation. Others are hangers on which he
hangs the clothes of wrath, of rage, of suppressed and mutating
aggression and, finally, of ill disguised violence. How should
the persons nearest and dearest to the narcissist cope with his
eccentric vagaries?</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The short answer is by abandoning him or by
threatening to abandon him. The threat to abandon need not be
explicit or conditional ("If you don't do something or if you do
it &ndash; I will desert you"). It is sufficient to confront the
narcissist, to insist, to shout back. The narcissist is tamed by
the very same weapons that he uses to subjugate others. The
spectre of being abandoned looms large over everything else.
Every discordant note assumes the monstrous attributes of
solitude, abandonment, and the resulting confrontation with his
self. The narcissist is a person who is irreparably traumatised
by the behaviour of the most important adults in his life: his
parents. By being capricious, arbitrary, and sadistically
judgemental &ndash; they moulded him into an adult, who fervently
and obsessively tries to recreate the trauma (repetition
complex). Thus, on the one hand, the narcissist feels that his
liberation depends upon re-living these experiences. On the other
hand, he is terrified by this prospect. Realising that he is
doomed to go through the same harrowing experience over and over
again, the narcissist distances himself from the scene of his own
pending emotional catastrophe. He does this by using his
aggression to alienate, to humiliate and in general, to be
emotionally absent. This behaviour brings about the very
consequences that the narcissist so derides. But, this way, at
least, the narcissist can tell himself (and others) that HE was
the one who controlled the events, that it was truly fully his
choice and that he was not surprised. The truth is that, governed
by his internal demons, the narcissist has no choice to talk
about.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist is, therefore, a binary
human being: the carrot is the stick in his case. If he gets too
close to someone emotionally, he fears ultimate and inevitable
abandonment. He, thus, distances himself, acts cruelly and brings
about the very abandonment that he feared in the first place. In
this paradox lies the key to coping with the narcissist: if he
has a rage attack &ndash; rage back. This will provoke in him
fears of being abandoned and the resulting calm will be so total
that it might seem unbelievable. Narcissists are known for these
sudden tectonic shifts in mood and in behaviour
patterns.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Mirror the narcissist's actions and repeat
his words. If he threatens &ndash; threaten back and credibly try
to use the same language and content. If he leaves the house
&ndash; leave it as well, disappear on him. If he is suspicious
&ndash; act suspicious. Be critical, denigrating, humiliating, go
down to his level &ndash; because that is where he permanently
is. Faced with his mirror image &ndash; the narcissist always
recoils.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">We must not forget: the narcissist does all
these things to foster and encourage abandonment. When mirrored,
the narcissist dreads imminent and impending abandonment, which
is the inevitable result of his actions and words. This prospect
so terrifies him &ndash; that it induces in him an incredible
alteration of his behaviour. He instantly succumbs and tries to
make amends, moving from one (cold and bitter, cynical and
misanthropic, cruel and sadistic) pole to another (warm, even
loving, the sort of fuzzy, engulfing emotion that we feel on a
particularly good or successful day).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The other way is to abandon him and go
about reconstructing your own life. Very few people deserve the
kind of investment that is an absolute prerequisite to living
with a narcissist. To cope with a narcissist is a full time,
energy and emotion-draining job, which reduces the persons around
the narcissist to insecure nervous wrecks. Who deserves such a
sacrifice?</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">No one, to my mind, not even the most
brilliant, charming, breathtaking, suave narcissist. The glamour
and trickery wear thin and underneath them a monster lurks which
sucks the affect, distorts the cognition and irreversibly
influences the lives of those around it for the worse.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Others delineate a more sweeping
dichotomous strategy. Both philosophically and pragmatically, we
cannot and should not assume responsibility for other people and
their lives. Narcissists are incorrigibly and notoriously
difficult to change. Trying to change them is a bad strategy. The
two viable strategies are either to accept them as they are or to
avoid them altogether. If one accepts a narcissist as he is
&ndash; one should cater to his needs. His needs are part of what
he is. Would you have ignored a physical handicap? Would you not
have assisted a quadriplegic? The narcissist is an emotional
invalid. He needs constant adulation. He cannot help it. So, if
one chooses to accept him &ndash; it is a package deal, all his
needs included.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Narcissists
and Women</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Do narcissists hate women?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode:line'>Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB"
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Narcissists abhor and dread getting
emotionally intimate. The cerebral ones regard sex as a
maintenance chore, something they have to do in order to keep
their Source of Secondary Supply. The somatic narcissist treats
women as objects and sex as a means to obtaining Narcissistic
Supply.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Moreover,
many narcissists tend to engage in FRUSTRATING behaviours towards
women. They refrain from having sex with them, tease them and
then leave them, resist flirtatious and seductive behaviours and
so on. Often, they invoke the existence of a
girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e/spouse (or boyfriend/etc. &ndash; male
and female are interchangeable in my texts) as the "reason" why
they cannot have sex/develop a relationship. But this is not out
of loyalty and fidelity in the empathic and loving sense. This is
because they wish (and often succeed) to sadistically frustrate
the interested party.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">BUT</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>This
pertains ONLY to cerebral narcissists, but NOT to somatic
narcissists and HPDs (Histrionic Personality Disorder) who use
their BODY, sex and seduction/flirtation to extract Narcissistic
Supply from others.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Narcissists
are misogynists. They team up with women as mere Sources of SNS
(Secondary Narcissistic Supply). The woman's chores are to
accumulate past NS and release it in an orderly manner, so as to
regulate the fluctuating flow of primary supply. Otherwise,
cerebral narcissists are not interested in women. Most of them
are non-sexual (engage in sexual acts very rarely, if at all).
They hold women in contempt and abhor the thought of being really
intimate with them. Usually, they choose submissive women, well
below their level, to perform these functions. This leads to a
vicious cycle of neediness, self-contempt ("How come I am
dependent on this inferior woman") and contempt directed at the
woman. Hence the abuse. When Primary NS is available &ndash; the
woman is hardly tolerated, as one would reluctantly pay the
premium of an insurance policy.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist does regard the "subjugation" of an attractive woman
to be a Source of Narcissistic Supply.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>It is a
status symbol, proof of virility and masculinity and it allows
him to engage in "vicarious" narcissistic behaviours (=being a
narcissist through others, transforming others into tools at the
service of his narcissism, into his extensions). This is done by
employing defence mechanisms such as projective identification.
Many of my FAQs and the Essay are dedicated to these
issues.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>To
re-iterate, Primary Narcissistic Supply (PNS) is ANY kind of NS
provided by others who are not "meaningful" or "significant"
others. Adulation, attention, affirmation, fame, notoriety,
sexual conquests &ndash; are all forms of NS.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Secondary NS
(SNS) emanates from people who are in CONSTANT, repetitive or
continuous touch with the narcissist. It includes the important
roles of narcissistic accumulation and narcissistic regulation,
among others. [See the Essay for more.]</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist believes that being in love IS actually going through
the motions and pretending. To him, emotions are mimicry and
pretence.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">He says: "I am a conscious misogynist. I
fear and loathe women and tend to ignore them to the best of my
ability. To me they are a mixture of hunter and
parasite."</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Most male
narcissists are misogynists. After all, they are the warped
creation of a woman. A woman gave birth to them and moulded them
into what they are: dysfunctional, maladaptive, emotionally dead.
They are angry at this woman and, by implication, mad at all
women.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist's attitude to women is, naturally, complex and
multi-layered but it can be summarised using four
axes:</span></p>

<p>1. The Holy Whore</p>

<p>2. The Hunter Parasite</p>

<p>3. The Frustrating Object of Desire</p>

<p>4. Uniqueness Roles</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist divides all women to saints and whores. He finds it
difficult to have sex ("dirty", "forbidden", "punishable",
"degrading") with feminine significant others (spouse, intimate
girlfriend). To him, sex and intimacy are mutually exclusive
rather than mutually expressive propositions. Sex is reserved to
"whores" (all other women in the world). This division provides
for a resolution of his constant cognitive dissonance ("I want
her but...", "I don't need anyone but..."). It also legitimises
his sadistic urges (abstaining from sex is a major and recurrent
narcissistic "penalty" inflicted on female "transgressors"). It
also tallies well with the frequent idealisation-devaluation
cycles the narcissist goes through. The idealised females are
sexless, the devalued ones &ndash; "deserving" of their
degradation (sex) and the contempt that, inevitably, follows
thereafter.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist believes firmly that women are out to "hunt" men and
that this is almost a genetic predisposition. As a result, he
feels threatened (as any prey would). This, of course, is an
intellectualisation of the real, absolutely opposite, state of
things: the narcissist feels threatened by women and tries to
justify this irrational fear by imbuing women with "objective"
qualities which make them, to his mind, ominous. This is a small
detail in a larger canvass of "pathologising" others as a means
of controlling them. According to the narcissist's scenario, once
the prey is secured &ndash; the woman assumes the role of a "body
snatcher". She absconds with the narcissist's sperm, she
generates an endless stream of demanding and nose dripping
children, she financially bleeds the men in her life to cater to
her needs and to the needs of her dependants. Put differently,
she is a parasite, a leech, whose sole function is to suck dry
every man she finds and tarantula-like decapitate them once no
longer useful. This, of course, is exactly what the narcissist
does to people. Thus, his view of women is a
projection.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>Heterosexual
narcissists desire women as any other red-blooded male does (even
more so due to the special symbolic nature of the woman in the
narcissist's life &ndash; humbling a woman in acts of faintly
sado-masochistic sex is a way of getting back at mother). But he
is frustrated by his inability to meaningfully interact with
them, by their apparent emotional depth and powers of
psychological penetration (real or attributed) and by their
sexuality. Their incessant demands for intimacy are perceived by
him as a threat. He recoils instead of getting closer. The
cerebral narcissist also despises and derides sex, as we said
before. Thus, caught in a seemingly intractable repetition
complex, in approach-avoidance cycles, the narcissist becomes
furious at the source of his frustration. Some of them set out to
do some frustrating of their own. They tease (passively or
actively), or they pretend to be non-sexual and, in any case,
they turn down, rather cruelly, any attempt by a woman to court
them and to get closer.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style=
'layout-grid-mode: line'>Sadistically, they tremendously enjoy
their ability to frustrate the desires, passions and sexual
wishes of women. It endows them with a feeling of omnipotence and
with the pleasing realisation of malevolence. Narcissists
regularly frustrate all women sexually &ndash; and engage in
frustrating significant women in their lives both sexually and
emotionally. Somatic narcissists simply use women as objects and
then discard them. The emotional background is identical. While
the cerebral narcissist punishes through abstention &ndash; the
somatic narcissist penalises through excess.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist's mother kept behaving as though the narcissist was
and is not special (to her). The narcissist's whole life is a
pathetic and pitiful effort to prove her wrong. The narcissist
constantly seeks confirmation from others that he IS special
&ndash; in other words that he IS. Women threaten this. Sex is
"bestial" and "common". There is nothing "special or unique"
about sex. Women are perceived by the narcissist to be dragging
him to their level, the level of the lowest common denominator of
intimacy, sex and human emotions. Everybody and anybody can feel,
copulate and breed. There is nothing to set the narcissist apart
and above others in these activities. And yet women seem to be
interested ONLY in these pursuits. Thus, the narcissist
emotionally believes that women are the continuation of his
mother by other means and in different guises.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style='layout-grid-mode: line'>The
narcissist hates women virulently, passionately and
uncompromisingly. His hate is primal, irrational, the progeny of
mortal fear and sustained abuse. Granted, most narcissists learn
how to suppress, disguise, even repress these untoward feelings.
But their hatred does swing out of control and erupt from time to
time. It is a terrifying, paralysing sight. It is the true
narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">To live with a narcissist is an arduous and
eroding task. Narcissists are atrabilious, infinitely
pessimistic, bad-tempered, paranoid and sadistic in an
absent-minded and indifferent manner. Their daily routine is a
rigmarole of threats, complaints, hurts, eruptions, moodiness and
rage. The narcissist rails against slights true and imagined. He
alienates people. He humiliates them because this is his only
weapon against the humiliation of their indifference.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Gradually, wherever he is, the narcissist's
social circle dwindles and then vanishes. Every narcissist is
also a schizoid, to some extent. A schizoid is not a misanthrope.
He does not necessarily hate people &ndash; he simply does not
need them. He regards social interactions as a nuisance to be
minimised.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist is torn between his need to
obtain Narcissistic Supply (monopolised by human beings) &ndash;
and his fervent wish to be left alone. This wish is peppered with
contempt and feelings of superiority.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">There are fundamental conflicts between
dependence and contempt, neediness and devaluation, seeking and
avoiding, turning on the charm to attract adulation and being
engulfed by wrathful reactions to the most minuscule
"provocations". These conflicts lead to rapid cycling between
gregariousness and self-imposed ascetic seclusion.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Such an unpredictable but always bilious
and festering atmosphere is hardly conducive to love or sex.
Gradually, both become extinct. Relationships are hollowed out.
Imperceptibly, the narcissist switches to a non-sexual
co-habitation.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">But the vitriolic environment that the
narcissist creates is only one hand of the equation. The other
hand is the woman herself.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">As we said, heterosexual narcissists are
attracted to women, but simultaneously repelled, horrified,
bewitched and provoked by them. They seek to frustrate and
humiliate them. Psychodynamically, the narcissist probably visits
upon them his mother's sins &ndash; but such an instant
explanation does the subject great injustice.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Most narcissists are misogynists. Their
sexual and emotional lives are perturbed and chaotic. They are
unable to love in any true sense of the word &ndash; nor are they
capable of developing any measure of intimacy. Lacking empathy,
they are unable to offer to the partner emotional
sustenance.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Do narcissists miss loving, would they have
liked to love and are they angry with their parents for crippling
them so?</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">To the narcissist, these questions are
incomprehensible. There is no way they can answer them.
Narcissists never love. They do not know what is it that they are
supposedly missing. Observing it from the outside, love seems to
them to be a risible pathology. They equate love with weakness.
They hate being weak and they hate and despise weak people (and,
therefore, the very old and the very young). They do not tolerate
what they consider to be stupidity, disease and dependence
&ndash; and love seems to encompass all three. These are not sour
grapes. They really feel this way.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Narcissists are angry men &ndash; but not
because they never experienced love and probably never will. They
are angry because they are not as powerful, awe inspiring and
successful as they wish they were and, to their mind, deserve to
be. Because their daydreams refuse so stubbornly to come true.
Because they are their worst enemy. And because, in their
unmitigated paranoia, they see adversaries plotting everywhere
and feel discriminated against and contemptuously
ignored.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Many of them (the borderline narcissists)
cannot conceive of a life in one place with one set of people,
doing the same thing, in the same field with one goal within a
decades-old game plan. To them, this is death. They are most
terrified of boredom and whenever faced with its daunting
prospect, they inject drama into their life, or even danger. This
is the only way some of them can feel alive.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist is a lonely wolf. He is a
shaky platform, indeed, on which to base a family, or future
plans.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">The Spouse/Mate/Partner of the
Narcissist</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">What kind of a spouse/mate/partner is likely to be
attracted to a narcissist?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span></i></b></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Victims</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">On the face of it, there is no (emotional)
partner or mate, who typically "binds" with a narcissist. They
come in all shapes and sizes. The initial phases of attraction,
infatuation and falling in love are pretty normal. The narcissist
puts on his best face &ndash; the other party is blinded by
budding love. A natural selection process occurs only much later,
as the relationship develops and is put to the test.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Living with a narcissist can be
exhilarating, is always onerous, often harrowing. Surviving a
relationship with a narcissist indicates, therefore, the
parameters of the personality of the survivor. She (or, more
rarely, he) is moulded by the relationship into The Typical
Narcissistic Mate/Partner/Spouse.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">First and foremost, the narcissist's
partner must have a deficient or a distorted grasp of his self
and of reality. Otherwise, she (or he) is bound to abandon the
narcissist's grip early on. The cognitive distortion is likely to
consist of a belittling and demeaning of the partner &ndash;
while aggrandising and adoring the narcissist. The partner is,
thus, placing himself in the position of the eternal victim:
undeserving, punishable, a scapegoat. Sometimes, it is very
important to the partner to appear moral, sacrificial and
victimised. At other times, she is not even aware of his
predicament. The narcissist is perceived by the partner to be a
person in the position to demand these sacrifices from the
partner, superior in many ways (intellectually, emotionally,
morally, financially).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The status of professional victim sits well
with the partner's tendency to punish his self, namely: with his
masochistic streak. The torment, which is life with a narcissist
is, as far as the partner is aware, a just punitive
measure.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In this respect, the partner is the mirror
image of the narcissist. By maintaining a symbiotic relationship
with him, by being totally dependent upon the source of
masochistic supply (which the narcissist most reliably
constitutes and most amply provides) &ndash; the partner enhances
certain traits and encourages certain behaviours, which are at
the very core of narcissism. The narcissist is never whole
without an adoring, submissive, available, self-denigrating
partner. His very sense of superiority, indeed his False Self,
depends on it. His sadistic Superego switches its attentions from
the narcissist (in whom it often provokes suicidal ideation) to
the partner, thus finally obtaining an alternative source of
sadistic satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It is through self-denial that the partner
survives. She denies her wishes, hopes, dreams, aspirations,
sexual needs, psychological needs, material needs, and much else
besides. She perceives her needs as threatening because they
might engender the wrath of the narcissist's God-like supreme
figure. The narcissist is rendered even more superior through and
because of this self-denial. Self-denial undertaken to facilitate
and ease the life of a "great man" is more palatable. The
"greater" the man (=the narcissist), the easier it is for the
partner to ignore her own self, to dwindle, to degenerate, to
turn into an appendix of the narcissist and, finally, to become
nothing but an extension, to merge with the narcissist to the
point of oblivion and of dim memories of one's self.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The two collaborate in this macabre dance.
The narcissist is formed by his partner inasmuch as he forms her.
Submission breeds superiority and masochism breeds sadism. The
relationships are characterised by rampant emergentism: roles are
allocated almost from the start and any deviation meets with an
aggressive, even violent reaction.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The predominant state of the partner's mind
is utter confusion. Even the most basic relationships &ndash;
with husband, children, or parents &ndash; remain bafflingly
obscured by the giant shadows cast by the intensive interaction
with the narcissist. A suspension of judgement is part and parcel
of a suspension of individuality, which is both a prerequisite to
and the result of living with a narcissist. The partner no longer
knows what is true and right and what is wrong and forbidden. The
narcissist recreates for the partner the sort of emotional
ambience that led to his own formation in the first place:
capriciousness, fickleness, arbitrariness, emotional (and
physical or sexual) abandonment. The world becomes uncertain and
frightening and the partner has only one sure thing to cling to:
the narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">And cling she does. If there is anything
which can safely be said about those who emotionally team up with
narcissists, it is that they are overtly and overly dependent,
even compulsively so.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The partner doesn't know what to do &ndash;
and this is only too natural in the mayhem that is the
relationship with the narcissist is. But the typical partner also
does not know what she wants and, to a large extent, who she is
and what she wants to become.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">These unanswered questions hamper the
partner's ability to gauge reality, evaluate and appraise it for
what it is. Her primordial sin is that she fell in love with an
image, not with a real person. It is the voiding of the image
that is mourned when the relationship ends.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The break-up of a relationship with a
narcissist is, therefore, very emotionally charged. It is the
culmination of a long chain of humiliations and of subjugation.
It is the rebellion of the functioning and healthy parts of the
partner's personality against the tyranny of the
narcissist.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The partner is liable to have totally
misread and misinterpreted the whole interaction (I hesitate to
call it a relationship). This lack of proper interface with
reality might be (erroneously) labelled
"pathological".</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Why is it that the partner seeks to prolong
her pain? What is the source and purpose of this masochistic
streak? Upon the break-up of the relationship, the partner (and
the narcissist) engage in a tortuous and drawn out post mortem.
But the question who really did what to whom (and even why) is
irrelevant. What is relevant is to stop mourning oneself (this is
what the parties are really mourning), start smiling again and
love in a less subservient, hopeless, and pain-inflicting
manner.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The Abuse</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Abuse is an integral, inseparable part of
the Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist idealises and then DEVALUES
and discards the object of his initial idealisation. This abrupt,
heartless devaluation IS abuse. ALL narcissists idealise and then
devalue. This is THE core of pathological narcissism. The
narcissist exploits, lies, insults, demeans, ignores (the "silent
treatment"), manipulates, controls. All these are forms of
abuse.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">There are a million ways to abuse. To love
too much is to abuse. It is tantamount to treating someone as
one's extension, an object, or an instrument of gratification. To
be over-protective, not to respect privacy, to be brutally
honest, or consistently tactless &ndash; is to abuse. To expect
too much, to denigrate, to ignore &ndash; are all modes of abuse.
There is physical abuse, verbal abuse, psychological abuse,
sexual abuse. The list is long. Narcissists are masters of
abusing surreptitiously. They are "stealth abusers". You have to
actually live with one in order to witness the abuse.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">There are three important categories of
abuse:</span></p>

<p><i>1. Overt Abuse</i> <span lang="EN-GB">&ndash; The open and
explicit abuse of another person. Threatening, coercing, beating,
lying, berating, demeaning, chastising, insulting, humiliating,
exploiting, ignoring ("silent treatment"), devaluing,
unceremoniously discarding, verbal abuse, physical abuse and
sexual abuse are all forms of overt abuse.</span></p>

<p><i>2. Covert or Controlling Abuse</i> <span lang=
"EN-GB">&ndash; Narcissism is almost entirely about control. It
is a primitive and immature reaction to life's circumstances in
which the narcissist (usually in his childhood) was rendered
helpless. It is about re-asserting one's identity,
re-establishing predictability, mastering the environment &ndash;
human and physical.</span></p>

<p>3. The bulk of narcissistic behaviours can be traced to this
panicky reaction to the remote potential for loss of control.
Narcissists are hypochondriacs (and difficult patients) because
they are afraid to lose control over their body, its looks and
its proper functioning. They are obsessive-compulsive in their
efforts to subdue their physical habitat and render it
foreseeable. They stalk people and harass them as a means of
"being in touch" &ndash; another form of narcissistic
control.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">But why the panic?</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist is a solipsist. He carries
the whole universe in his mind. To him, nothing exists except
himself. Meaningful others are his extensions, assimilated by
him, internal objects &ndash; not external ones. Thus, losing
control of a significant other &ndash; is equivalent to the loss
of control of a limb, or of one's brain. It is terrifying. It is
paradigm-shattering.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Independent or disobedient people evoke in
the narcissist the realisation that something is wrong with his
worldview, that he is not the centre of the world or its cause
and that he cannot control what, to him, are internal
representations.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">To the narcissist, losing control means
going insane. Because other people are mere elements in the
narcissist's mind &ndash; being unable to manipulate them
literally means losing it (his mind). Imagine, if you suddenly
were to find out that you cannot manipulate your memories or
control your thoughts... Nightmarish!</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Moreover, it is often only through
manipulation and extortion that the narcissist can secure his
Narcissistic Supply. Controlling his Sources of Narcissistic
Supply is a (mental) life or death question for the narcissist.
The narcissist is a drug addict (his drug being the NS) and he
would go to any length to obtain the next dose.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In his frantic efforts to maintain control
or re-assert it, the narcissist resorts to a myriad of fiendishly
inventive stratagems and mechanisms. Here is a partial
list:</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Unpredictability</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist acts unpredictably,
capriciously, inconsistently and irrationally. This serves to
demolish in others their carefully crafted worldview. They become
dependent upon the next twist and turn of the narcissist, his
next inexplicable whim, upon his next outburst, denial, or smile.
Because he is assumed to be the only one intimately acquainted
with his self &ndash; he becomes the source of certitude and
veracity. In other words: the narcissist makes sure that HE is
the only reliable existence in the lives of others &ndash; by
shattering the rest of their world through his seemingly insane
behaviour. He guarantees his stable presence in their lives
&ndash; by destabilising their own.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the absence of a self, there are no
likes or dislikes, preferences, predictable behaviour or
characteristics. It is not possible to know the narcissist. There
is no one there.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist was conditioned &ndash; from
an early age of abuse and trauma &ndash; to expect the
unexpected. His was a world in motion where (sometimes
sadistically) capricious caretakers and peers often engaged in
arbitrary behaviour. He was trained to deny his True Self and
nurture a False one.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Having invented himself, the narcissist
sees no problem in re-inventing that which he designed in the
first place. The narcissist is his own creator.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Hence his grandiosity.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Moreover, the narcissist is a man for all
seasons, forever adaptable, constantly imitating and emulating, a
human sponge, a perfect mirror, a non-entity that is, at the same
time, all entities combined. The narcissist is best described by
Heidegger's phrase: "Being and Nothingness". Into this reflective
vacuum, this sucking black hole, the narcissist attracts the
sources of his Narcissistic Supply.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">To an observer, the narcissist appears to
be fractured or discontinuous.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Pathological narcissism has been compared
to the Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly the Multiple
Personality Disorder). By definition, the narcissist has at least
two selves. His personality is very primitive and disorganised.
Living with a narcissist is a nauseating experience not only
because of what he is &ndash; but because of what he is NOT. He
is not a fully formed human &ndash; but a dizzyingly
kaleidoscopic gallery of mercurial images, which melt into each
other seamlessly. It is incredibly disorienting.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">It is also exceedingly problematic.
Promises made by the narcissist are easily disowned by him. His
plans are ephemeral. His emotional ties &ndash; a simulacrum.
Most narcissists have one island of stability in their life
(spouse, family, their career, a hobby, their religion, country,
or idol) &ndash; pounded by the turbulent currents of a
dishevelled existence.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Thus, to invest in a narcissist is a
purposeless, futile and meaningless activity. To the narcissist,
every day is a new beginning, a hunt, a new cycle of idealisation
or devaluation, a newly invented self. There is no accumulation
of credits or goodwill because the narcissist has no past and no
future. He occupies an eternal and timeless present. He is a
fossil caught in the frozen lava of a volcanic
childhood.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist does not keep agreements,
does not adhere to laws, regards consistency and predictability
as demeaning traits.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Disproportional Reactions</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">One of the favourite tools of manipulation
in the narcissist's arsenal is the disproportionality of his
reactions. He reacts with supreme rage to the slightest slight.
He punishes severely for what he perceives to be an offence
against him, no matter how minor. He throws a temper tantrum over
any discord or disagreement, however gently and considerately
expressed. Or he may act inordinately attentive, charming and
tempting (even over-sexed, if need be). This ever-shifting
conduct coupled with the inordinately harsh and arbitrarily
applied "penal code" are both designed by the narcissist and
remain inaccessible to the "offenders". Neediness and dependence
on the source of all justice meted &ndash; on the narcissist
&ndash; are thus guaranteed.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Dehumanisation and Objectification
(Abuse)</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">People have a need to believe in the
empathic skills and basic good-heartedness of others. By
dehumanising and objectifying people &ndash; the narcissist
attacks the very foundations of the social treaty. This is the
"alien" aspect of narcissists &ndash; they may be excellent
imitations of fully formed adults but they are emotionally
non-existent, or, at best, immature.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This is so horrid, so repulsive, so
phantasmagoric &ndash; that people recoil in terror. It is then,
with their defences absolutely down, that they are the most
susceptible and vulnerable to the narcissist's control. Physical,
psychological, verbal and sexual abuse are all forms of
dehumanisation and objectification.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Abuse of Information</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">From the first moments of an encounter with
another person, the narcissist is on the prowl. He collects
information with the intention of applying it later to extract
Narcissistic Supply. The more he knows about his potential Source
of Supply &ndash; the better able he is to coerce, manipulate,
charm, extort or convert it "to the cause". The narcissist does
not hesitate to abuse the information he gleaned, regardless of
its intimate nature or the circumstances in which he obtained it.
This is a powerful tool in his armoury.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Impossible Situations</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist engineers impossible,
dangerous, unpredictable, unprecedented, or highly specific
situations in which he is sorely and indispensably needed. The
narcissist, his knowledge, his skills or his traits become the
only ones applicable, or the most useful to resolving them. It is
a form of control by proxy.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Control by Proxy</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">If all else fails, the narcissist recruits
friends, colleagues, mates, family members, the authorities,
institutions, neighbours &ndash; in short, third parties &ndash;
to do his bidding. He uses them to cajole, coerce, threaten,
stalk, offer, retreat, tempt, convince, harass, communicate and
otherwise manipulate his target. He controls these unaware
instruments exactly as he plans to control his ultimate prey. He
employs the same mechanisms and devices. And he dumps his props
unceremoniously when the job is done.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Another form of control by proxy is to
engineer situations in which abuse is inflicted upon another
person. Such carefully crafted scenarios involve embarrassment
and humiliation as well as social sanctions (condemnation,
opprobrium, or even physical punishment). Society, or a social
group become the instruments of the narcissist.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Ambient Abuse</span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The fostering, propagation and enhancement
of an atmosphere of fear, intimidation, instability,
unpredictability and irritation. There are no acts of traceable
or provable explicit abuse, nor any manipulative settings of
control. Yet, the irksome feeling remains, a disagreeable
foreboding, a premonition, a bad omen. This is sometimes called
"gas-lighting". In the long-term, such an environment erodes
one's sense of self-worth and self-esteem. Self-confidence is
shaken badly. Often, the victims adopt a paranoid or schizoid
stance and thus render themselves exposed even more to criticism
and judgement. The roles are thus reversed: the victim is
considered the mentally disordered component of the dyad and the
narcissist &ndash; the suffering soul.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">The Narcissist and His Family</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Is there a "typical" relationship between the narcissist
and his family?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">We are all members of a few families in our lifetime: the
one that we are born to and the one(s) that we create. We all
transfer hurts, attitudes, fears, hopes and desires &ndash; a
whole emotional baggage &ndash; from the former to the latter.
The narcissist is no exception.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The narcissist has a dichotomous view of
humanity: humans are either Sources of Narcissistic Supply (and,
then, idealised and over-valued) or do not fulfil this function
(and, therefore, are valueless, devalued). The narcissist gets
all the love that he needs from himself. From the outside he
needs approval, affirmation, admiration, adoration, attention
&ndash; in other words, externalised Ego boundary functions. He
does not require &ndash; nor does he seek &ndash; his parents' or
his siblings' love, or to be loved by his children. He casts them
as the audience in the theatre of his inflated grandiosity. He
wishes to impress them, shock them, threaten them, infuse them
with awe, inspire them, attract their attention, subjugate them,
or manipulate them. He emulates and simulates an entire range of
emotions and employs every means to achieve these effects. He
lies (narcissists are pathological liars &ndash; their very self
is a false one). He plays the pitiful, or, its opposite, the
resilient and reliable. He stuns and shines with outstanding
intellectual, or physical (or anything else appreciated by the
members of the family) capacities and achievements. When
confronted with (young) siblings or with his own children, the
narcissist is likely to undergo three reactive phases:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">At first, he perceives his offspring as a
threat to his Narcissistic Supply Sources (his turf, the
Pathological Narcissistic Space). He does his best to belittle
them, hurt (also physically) and humiliate them and then, when
these reactions prove ineffective or counter productive, he
retreats into an imaginary world of omnipotence. A period of
emotional absence and detachment ensues. The narcissist indulges
himself in daydreaming, delusions of grandeur, planning of future
coups, nostalgia and hurt (the Lost Paradise Syndrome). The
narcissist reacts this way to the birth of his children or to the
introduction of new centres of attention to the family cell (even
a new pet!). Whatever the narcissist perceives to be his
competition for scarce Narcissistic Supply is relegated to the
role of the enemy. Where no legitimacy exists for the uninhibited
expression of the aggression and hostility aroused by this
predicament &ndash; the narcissist prefers to stay away. He
disconnects, detaches himself emotionally, becomes cold and
disinterested, directs transformed anger at his mate or at his
parents (the more legitimate targets).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Other narcissists see the opportunity in
the "mishap". They seek to manipulate their parents (or their
mate) by "taking over" the newcomer. Such narcissists monopolise
their siblings or their newborn children. This way, indirectly,
the narcissist basks in the attention directed at the infant. An
example: by being closely identified with his offspring, a
narcissistic father secures the grateful admiration of the mother
("What an outstanding father he is"). He also assumes part of or
all the credit for baby's/sibling's achievements. This is a
process of annexation and assimilation of the other, a strategy
that the narcissist makes use of in most of his
relationships.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">As the baby/sibling grows older, the
narcissist begins to see their potential to be edifying, reliable
and satisfactory Sources of Narcissistic Supply. His attitude,
then, is completely transformed. The former threats have now
become promising potentials. He cultivates those whom he trusts
to be the most rewarding. He encourages them to idolise him, to
adore him, to be awed by him, to admire his deeds and
capabilities, to learn to blindly trust and obey him, in short to
surrender to his charisma and to become submerged in his
folies-de-grandeur. These roles &ndash; allocated to them
explicitly and demandingly or implicitly and perniciously by the
narcissist &ndash; are best fulfilled by ones whose mind is not
fully formed and independent. The older the siblings or
offspring, the more they become critical, even judgemental, of
the narcissist. They are better able to put into context and
perspective his actions, to question his motives, to anticipate
his moves. They refuse to continue to play the mindless pawns in
his chess game. They hold grudges against him for what he has
done to them in the past, when they were less capable of
resistance. They can gauge his true stature, talents and
achievements &ndash; which, usually, lag far behind the claims
that he makes.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This brings the narcissist a full cycle
back to the first phase. Again, he perceives his Siblings or
sons/daughters as threats. He quickly becomes disillusioned, in
one of the spastic devaluation reactions typical of his appraisal
of humans around him. He loses all interest, becomes emotionally
remote, absent and cold, rejects any effort to communicate with
him, citing life pressures and the preciousness and scarceness of
his time. He feels burdened, cornered, besieged, suffocated, and
claustrophobic. He wants to get away, to abandon his commitments
to people who have become totally useless (or even damaging) to
him. He does not understand why he has to support them, to suffer
their company and he believes himself to have been trapped. He
rebels either passively-aggressively (by refusing to act or
intentionally sabotaging the relationships) or actively (by being
overly critical, aggressive, unpleasant, verbally and
psychologically abusive and so on). Slowly &ndash; to justify his
acts to himself &ndash; he gets immersed in conspiracy theories
with clear paranoid hues. To his mind, the members of the family
conspire against him, seek to belittle or humiliate or
subordinate him, do not understand him, stymie his growth. The
narcissist usually finally gets what he wants and the family that
he has created disintegrates to his great sorrow (due to the loss
of the narcissistic space) &ndash; but also to his great relief
and surprise (how could they have let go someone as unique as
he?).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This is the cycle: the narcissist feels
threatened by arrival of new family members &ndash; assimilation
of siblings or offspring &ndash; obtaining Narcissistic Supply
from them &ndash; overvaluation of these new sources by the
narcissist &ndash; as sources grow older and independent, they
adopt anti narcissistic behaviours &ndash; the narcissist
devalues them &ndash; the narcissist feels stifled and trapped
&ndash; the narcissist becomes paranoid &ndash; the narcissist
rebels and the family disintegrates. This cycle characterises not
only the family life of the narcissist. It is to be found in
other realms of his life (his career, for instance). At work, the
narcissist, initially, feels threatened (no one knows him, he is
a nobody). Then, he develops a circle of admirers, cronies and
friends which he "nurtures and cultivates" in order to obtain
Narcissistic Supply from them. He overvalues them (they are the
brightest, the most loyal, with the biggest chances to climb the
corporate ladder and other superlatives).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">But following some anti-narcissistic
behaviours on their part (a critical remark, a disagreement, a
refusal, however polite, all constitute such behaviours) &ndash;
the narcissist devalues all these previously over-valued
individuals. Now they are stupid, lack ambition, skills and
talents, common (the worst expletive in the narcissist's
vocabulary), with an unspectacular career ahead of them. The
narcissist feels that he is misallocating his resources (for
instance, his time). He feels besieged and suffocated. He rebels
and erupts in a serious of self-defeating and self-destructive
behaviours, which lead to the disintegration of his
life.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Doomed to build and ruin, attach and
detach, appreciate and depreciate, the narcissist is predictable
in his "death wish". What sets him apart from other suicidal
types is that his wish is granted to him in small, tormenting
doses throughout his anguished life.</span></p>

style='font-size:8.0pt'>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION # 76</span></p>

<h1><span lang="EN-GB">Narcissists, Sex and Fidelity</span></h1>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Question:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Are narcissists mostly hyperactive or hypoactive sexually
and to what extent are they likely to be infidel in
marriage?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span></i></b> <span lang=
"EN-GB">Broadly speaking, there are two types of narcissists
loosely corresponding to the two categories mentioned in the
question. Sex for the narcissist is an instrument designed to
increase the number of Sources of Narcissistic Supply. If it
happens to be the most efficient weapon in the narcissist's
arsenal &ndash; he will make profligate use of it. In other
words: if the narcissist cannot obtain adoration, admiration,
approval, applause, or any other kind of attention by other means
(e.g., intellectually) &ndash; he resorts to sex. He then become
a satyr (or a nymphomaniac): indiscriminately engages in sex with
multiple partners. His sex partners are considered by him to be
objects not of desire &ndash; but of Narcissistic Supply. It is
through the processes of successful seduction and sexual conquest
that the narcissist derives his badly needed narcissistic "fix".
The narcissist is likely to perfect his techniques of courting
and regard his sexual exploits as a form of art. He is very
likely to expose this side of him &ndash; in great detail &ndash;
to others, to an audience, expecting to win their approval and
admiration. Because the Narcissistic Supply in his case resides
in the act of conquest and (what he perceives to be)
subordination &ndash; the narcissist is forced to move on and to
switch and bewitch partners very often. The first sexual
encounter with a partner always includes these elements &ndash;
not so the second or third encounters.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Some narcissists prefer "complicated"
situations. If men &ndash; they prefer virgins, married women,
avowed maidens, etc. The more "difficult" the target &ndash; the
more rewarding the narcissistic outcome. Such a narcissist may be
married, but he does not regard his extra-marital affairs as
either immoral or a breach of any explicit or implicit contract
between him and his spouse. He keeps explaining to anyone who
cares to listen that his other sexual partners are nothing to
him, meaningless, that he is merely taking advantage of them and
that they do not constitute a threat and should not be taken
seriously by his spouse. In his mind a clear separation exists
between the honest "woman of his life" (really, a saint) and the
whores that he is having sex with. He tends to cast the whole
feminine sub-species in a bad light (with the exception of the
meaningful women in his life). His behaviour will, thus, have
achieved a dual purpose: the securing of Narcissistic Supply, on
the one hand &ndash; and bringing about a replay of old,
unresolved conflicts and traumas (abandonment and the Oedipal
conflict, to mention but two). When inevitably abandoned by his
spouse &ndash; the narcissist is veritably shocked and hurt. This
is the sort of crisis, which might drive him to psychotherapy.
Still, deep inside, he feels compelled to continue to pursue
precisely the same path. His abandonment is cathartic, purifying.
Following a period of deep depression and suicidal ideation
&ndash; the narcissist is likely to feel cleansed, invigorated,
unshackled, ready for the next round of hunting.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">But there is another type of narcissist. He
also has bouts of sexual hyperactivity in which he trades sexual
partners and tends to regard them as objects. However, with him,
this is a secondary behaviour. It appears mainly after major
narcissistic traumas and crises. A painful divorce, a major
personal financial upheaval &ndash; and this type of narcissist
adopts the view that the "old solutions" do not work anymore. He
frantically gropes and searches for new ways to attract
attention, to restore his False Ego (=his grandiosity) and to
secure the subsistence level of Narcissistic Supply. Sex is handy
and is a great source of the right kind of supply: immediate,
interchangeable, comprehensive (it encompasses all the aspects of
the narcissist's being), natural, highly charged, adventurous,
pleasurable. Thus, following a life crisis, the cerebral
narcissist is likely to be deeply involved in sexual activities
&ndash; very frequently and almost to the exclusion of other
matters.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">However, as the memories of the crisis
fade, as the narcissistic wounds heal, as the Narcissistic Cycle
re-commences and the balance is restored &ndash; the second type
of narcissist reveals his true colours. He abruptly loses
interest in sex and in all his sexual partners. The frequency of
his sexual activities deteriorates from a few times a day &ndash;
to a few times a year. He prefers intellectual pursuits, sports,
politics, volunteering &ndash; anything but sex. This kind of
narcissist is afraid of encounters with the opposite sex and is
even more afraid of emotional involvement or commitment that he
fancies himself prone to develop following a sexual encounter. In
general, such a narcissist withdraws not only sexually &ndash;
but also emotionally. If married &ndash; he loses all overt
interest in his spouse, sexual or otherwise. He confines himself
to his world and makes sure that he is sufficiently busy to
preclude any interaction with his nearest (and supposedly
dearest). He becomes completely immersed in "big projects",
lifelong plans, a vision, or a cause &ndash; all very rewarding
narcissistically and all very demanding and time consuming. He
then regards sex as an obligation, a necessity, or a maintenance
operation needed to preserve the comfortable human cell that he
has constructed (his family or household). He does not enjoy sex
and by far prefers the autoerotic variety &ndash; to masturbate
&ndash; or object sex, like going to prostitutes. Actually, he
uses his mate or spouse as an "alibi", a shield against the
attention of other women, an insurance policy which preserves his
virile image while making it socially and morally commendable for
him to avoid any intimate or sexual contact with other women.
Even while ignoring women around him (a form of aggression) he
can feel righteous in saying: "I am loyal to my wife". At the
same time, he feels hostility towards her for ostensibly
preventing him from freely expressing himself sexually with
others, for isolating him from carnal pleasures. The thwarted
logic goes like this: "I am married/attached to this woman.
Therefore, I am not allowed to be in any kind of touch with other
women, which might be interpreted as more than casual or
businesslike. This is why I refrain from having anything to do
with women &ndash; because I am loyal, as opposed to most other
immoral men. However, I do not like this situation. I envy my
free peers. They can engage in sex and romance as much as they
want to &ndash; while I am confined to this marriage, chained by
my wife, my freedom curbed. I am angry at her and I will punish
her by abstaining from having sex with her." He minimises all
types of intercourse with his close circle (spouse, children,
parents, siblings, very intimate friends): sexual, verbal, or
emotional. He limits himself to the rawest exchanges of
information and isolates himself socially. This way he insures
against a future hurt and avoids the intimacy that he so dreads.
But, again, this way he also secures abandonment and the replay
of old, unresolved, conflicts. Finally, he really is left alone
by everyone, with no Secondary Sources of Supply. In his search
for them, he again embarks on ego-mending bouts of sex, followed
by the selection of a spouse or a mate (a Secondary Narcissistic
Supply Source). Then the cycle re-commence: a sharp drop in
sexual activity, emotional remoteness and cruel detachment
leading to abandonment.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The second type of narcissist is mostly
sexually loyal to his spouse. He alternates between what appears
to be hyper-sexuality and non-sexuality (really, forcefully
repressed sexuality). In the latter phase, he feels no sexual
urges, bar the most basic. He is, therefore, not compelled to
"cheat" upon his mate, betray her, or violate the marital vows.
He is much more interested in preventing a worrisome dwindling of
the Narcissistic Supply that really matters. Sex, he says to
himself, contentedly, is for those who can do no
better.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">I am often asked whether narcissists are
some variant of exhibitionists. Somatic narcissists tend to
verbal exhibitionism. They tend to brag in graphic details about
their conquests and exploits. In extreme cases, they might
introduce "live witnesses" and revert to total, classical
exhibitionism. This sits well with their tendency to "objectify"
their sexual partners, to engage in emotionally-neutral sex
(group sex, for instance) and to indulge in autoerotic sex. The
exhibitionist sees himself reflected in the eyes of the
beholders. This constitutes the main sexual stimulus, this is
what turns him on. This outside "look" is also what defines the
narcissist. There is bound to be a connection. One (the
exhibitionist) may be the culmination, the "pure case" of the
other (the narcissist).</span></p>
